this letter, a 10-GHz mixer is employed between the antenna and the SDR to downconvert Starlink LEO SV signals from 11.325 GHz to 1.325 GHz. In order to formulate a detection problem to detect the activity of Starlink downlink signals, a signal model is proposed that solely relies on the periodicity of the transmitted signals. The logic behind the proposed signal model is that in most commercial communication systems, a periodic RS is transmitted for synchronization purposes, e.g., primary synchronization signals (PSSs) in long-term evolution (LTE) and the ﬁfth generation (5G) signals. The following subsection presents a model for the Starlink LEO SV’s downlink signals. B. Baseband Signal Model As mentioned previously, in most commercial communication systems, a periodic RS is transmitted, e.g., PSS in OFDMA-based and spreading codes in code division multiple access-based signals. In this letter, the Starlink LEO SV downlink signal is modeled as an unknown periodic signal in the presence of interference and noise. If an RS, such as PSS in OFDMA-based signals, is being periodically transmitted, it will be detected and estimated

was observed that during the kth processing interval, the instantaneous Doppler frequency is nearly a linear function of time, i.e., fD = fDk + βkn, where fDk is referred to as constant Doppler, and βk is the Doppler rate at the kth processing interval. The coherent processing interval (CPI) is deﬁned as the time interval in which the constant Doppler, fDk, and the Doppler rate, βk, are constant. The received signal at the nth time instant when the Doppler rate is wiped-off is denoted by r′ ≜ exp(−j2πβkn2)r. One can deﬁne the desired RS which is going to be detected in the acquisition stage as s ≜αc] exp  j2π fDkTsn  (2) and the equivalent noise as weq = d] exp  j2π fDkTsn  LETTER 2607 Authorized licensed use limited to: Tsinghua University.

Due to the periodicity of the RS, s has the following property: s = s exp  jωkmL  0 ≤n ≤L −1 (4) where ωk ≜2π fDkTs is the normalized Doppler at the kth CPI, and −π ≤ωk ≤π. A vector of L observation samples corresponding to the mth period of the signal is formed as zm ≜, r′, . . . , r′]T. (5) The kth CPI vector is constructed by concatenating M vectors of length L to form the ML × 1 vector yk = T. (6) Therefore, yk = Hks + weqk (7) where s = ]T, and the ML × L Doppler matrix is deﬁned as Hk ≜T (8) where IL is an L × L identity matrix and weqk is the equivalent noise vector. III. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK This section presents the structure of the proposed framework. The proposed receiver consists of two main stages: (i) acquisition and (ii) tracking. In the acquisition stage, an estimate of the period of the RS in the Downlink signal of Starlink SV, and an initial estimate for the Doppler parameters are provided at k = 0, which is discussed in the following subsection. In order for the receiver to reﬁne and maintain the Doppler estimate, a tracking stage is also presented. A. Acquisition In this section, a detection scheme is proposed to detect the existence of Starlink LEO SVs in the carrier frequency of 11.325 GHz within a bandwidth of 2.5 MHz, at k = 0. The following binary hypothesis test is used to detect the Starlink LEO SV signal  H0: y0 = weq0 H1: y0 = H0s + weq0. (9) For a given set of unknown variables W0 = {L, ω0, β0}, the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) detector for the testing hypothesis (9) is known as matched subspace detector , , and is derived as (see ) L(y0|W0) = yH 0 PH0y0 yH 0 P⊥ H0y0 H1≷ H0 η (10) where yH 0 is the Hermitian transpose of y0, PH0 ≜ H0(HH 0 H0)−1HH 0 denotes the projection matrix to the column space of H0, P⊥ H0 ≜I −PH0 denotes the projection Fig. 1. Acquisition: The likelihood function versus Doppler frequency and the period at Starlink downlink carrier frequency of 11.325 GHz. matrix onto the space orthogonal to the column space of H0, and η is the threshold, which is predetermined according to the probability of false alarm. Since, HH k Hk = MIL for all k, the likelihood L(y0|W0) can be rewritten as L(y0|W0) = 1 ∥y0∥2 1 M2 ∥HH 0 y0∥2 −1, which is a monotonically increasing function of ∥HH 0 y0∥2 ∥y0∥2 . Hence, the GLR detector (10) is equivalent to ∥HH 0 y0∥2 ∥y0∥2 H1≷ H0 η′ (11) where η′ is determined according to a desired probability of false alarm. The maximum likelihood estimate of W0 is ˆ W0 = argmaxL,ω0,β0∥HH 0 y0∥2. (12) It should be pointed out that the estimated Doppler using

This constant ambiguity is accounted for the navigation ﬁlter. Fig. 1 demonstrates the likelihood in terms of Doppler frequency and the period for real Starlink downlink signals. The CPI was set to be 200 times the period. As it can be seen in Fig. 1, a Starlink LEO SV downlink signal is detectedwithaperiodof32μsandataDopplerfrequencyof −2745 Hz. B. Doppler Tracking Algorithm It is important to note that the receiver does not have knowledge of the Doppler ambiguity fa. The Doppler frequency that will be tracked by the receiver contains this constant ambiguity. In order to track the Doppler, a KF-based tracking loop is developed. The KF formulation allows for arbitrary Doppler model order selection, which is crucial due to the LEO SVs’ high dynamics. The KF-based Doppler tracking algorithm is described as follows. 1) Doppler Dynamics Model: The time-varying component of the continuous-time true Doppler, denoted by f (t), is a function of (i) the true range rate between the LEO SV and the receiver, denoted by ˙d(t), and the (ii) time-varying difference between the receiver’s and LEO SV’s clock bias rate, denoted by ˙b(t), expressed in meters 2608 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS VOL. 58, NO. 3 JUNE 2022 Authorized licensed use limited to: Tsinghua University.

The clock bias is assumed to have a constant drift, i.e., b(t) = a · (t − t0) + b0, where a is the clock drift, b is the constant bias, and t0 is the initial time. Moreover, simulations with Starlink LEO SVs show that the kinematic model ... d (t) = ˜w(t), where ˜w is a zero-mean white noise process with power spectral density q ˜w holds for short periods of time. Let k denote the time index corresponding to tk = kT + t0, where T = MLTs is the sampling interval also known as subaccumulation period, and ML is the number of subaccumulated samples. The vector ωk ≜T is considered as the Doppler state vector for the proposed tracking algorithm. The initial state is given by ω0 = T. 2) KF-Based Doppler Tracking: Let ˆωk|l and Pk|l denote the KF estimate of ωk and corresponding estimation error covariance, respectively, given all measurements up to time-step l ≤k. The initial estimate ˆω0|0 with a corresponding P0|0 are provided from the acquisition stage. The KFbased tracking algorithm follows a regular KF for the time update. The measurement update is discussed next. The KF measurement update equations are carried out based on the maximum likelihood estimate of the Doppler. The Doppler wipe-off is performed as ˜rk = r exp, where ˆθk+i|k is obtained according to ˆθk+i|k = ˆωk|kiTs + ˆ˙ωk|k i2 2 T 2 s , for i = 0, . . . , ML −1. The vector ˜yk+1 is constructed as ˜yk+1 = ]T. One can show that ˜yk+1 = ˜Hk+1s + ˜weqk+1 (13) where the residual Doppler matrix is ˜Hk+1 ≜T (14) and ωk+1 = ωk+1 −ˆωk+1|k. The proposed KF innovation is given by νk+1 = argmaxωk+1 1 M ∥˜HH k+1˜yk+1∥2 (15) which is a direct measure of the Doppler error. The measurement noise is chosen proportional to the Doppler search step size. The initial estimates of the Doppler ˆω0|0 and the Doppler rate ˆ˙ω0|0 are obtained from the acquisition stage. IV.

tracking and positioning with Starlink signals of opportunity. A stationary National Instrument (NI) universal software radio peripheral (USRP) 2945R was equipped with a consumer-grade Ku antenna and low-noise block (LNB) downconverter to receive Starlink signals in the Ku-band. The sampling rate was set to 2.5 MHz and the carrier frequency was set to 11.325 GHz, which is one of the Starlink downlink frequencies. The samples of the Ku signal Fig. 2.

presented next. A.

The USRP was set to record Ku signals over a period of 800 s. During this period, a total of six Starlink SVs transmitting at 11.325 GHz passed over the receiver, one at a time. The framework discussed in Section III was used to acquire the downlink signals and track the Doppler frequencies and rates from these LEO SVs, which are shown in Fig. 2 along with the ones predicted from two-line element (TLE) ﬁles . It can be seen that the proposed algorithm is tracking the Doppler and the Doppler rate of six Starlink LEO SVs. It can also be seen that the estimated Doppler frequencies have a constant bias compared to the predicted ones from the TLEs. B. Position Estimation Next, pseudorange rate observables are formed from the tracked Doppler frequencies by downsampling by a factor D to avoid large time correlations in the pseudorange observables and multiplying by the wavelength to express the Doppler frequencies in meters per second. Let i ∈{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} denote the SV index. The pseudorange rate observable to the ith SV at time step κ = k · D, expressed in meters, is modeled as zi(κ) = ˙rT SVi(κ)  rr −rSVi(κ)  rr −rSVi(κ)  2 + ai + vzi(κ) (16) where rr and rSVi(κ) are the receiver’s and ith Starlink SV 3D position vectors, ˙rSVi(κ) is the ith Starlink SV 2-D velocity vector, ai is the constant bias due to the unknown Doppler frequency ambiguity fa, and vzi(κ) is the measurement noise, which is modeled as a zero-mean, white Gaussian random variable with variance σ 2 i (κ). The value of σ 2 i (κ) is the ﬁrst diagonal element of Pκ|κ, expressed in m 2/ s2. Next, deﬁne the parameter vector x ≜T. Let z LETTER 2609 Authorized licensed use limited to: Tsinghua University.

denote the vector of all the pseudorange observables stacked together, and let vz denote the vector of all measurement noises stacked together, which is a zero-mean Gaussian randomvectorwithadiagonalcovariance R whosediagonal elements are given by σ 2 i (κ). Then, one can readily write the measurement equation given by z = g(x) + vz, where g(x) is a vector-valued function that maps the parameter x to the pseudorange rate observables according to (16). Next, a weighted nonlinear least-squares (WNLS) estimator with weight matrix R−1 is solved to obtain an estimate of x given by ˆx = T. The SV positions were obtained from TLE ﬁles and SGP4 software. It is important to note thattheTLEepochtimewasadjustedforeachSVtoaccount for ephemeris errors. This was achieved by minimizing the pseudorange rate residuals for each SV. Subsequently, the receiver position was estimated using the aforementioned WNLS. The 3-D position error was found to be 22.9 m, while the 2-D position error was 10 m.

Theoreticalandexperimentalstudieshavedemonstrated the potential of low Earth orbit (LEO) broadband communication satellites as promising reliable sources for navigation –. Companies like Amazon, Telesat, and SpaceX are deploying so-called megaconstellations to provide global broadband internet . In particular, launching thousands of space vehicles (SVs) into LEO by SpaceX can be considered as a turning point in the future of LEO-based navigation technologies. Although they suffer from higher Doppler effect, signals received from LEO SVs can be about 30 dB stronger than signals received from medium Earth orbit (MEO) SVs, where global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) SVs reside . Research has shown that one could exploit LEO SV broadband communication signals opportunistically for navigation purposes . Three of the main challenges of navigation with Starlink SV signals are as follows: 1) Limited information about the signal structure. 2) Very-high dynamics of Starlink LEO SVs. 3) Poorly known ephemerides.

Starlink Downlink Signals Except for the carrier frequencies and the bandwidths, more detailed signal speciﬁcations of Starlink downlink signals are unavailable to the public. SpaceX uses the Ku-band spectrum for the satellite-to-user links (both uplink and downlink) and the satellite-to-ground contacts are carried out in Ka-band . Software-deﬁned radios (SDRs) allow one to sample bands of the radio frequency spectrum. However, Ku/Ka-bands are beyond the carrier frequency of most

Starlink LEO SV’s signals suffer from very high Doppler shifts. Higher lengths of processing intervals require higher order Doppler models. In order for a Doppler estimation algorithm to provide an accurate estimate of the Doppler frequency, the processing interval should be large enough to accumulate enough power. According to the
