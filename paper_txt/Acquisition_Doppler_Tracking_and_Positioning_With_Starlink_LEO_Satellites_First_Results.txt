Acquisition, Doppler Tracking, and Positioning With
Starlink LEO Satellites: First Results
This letter shows the ﬁrst acquisition, Doppler tracking, and po-
sitioning results with Starlink’s low Earth orbit satellite signals. A
generalized-likelihood-ratio-based test is proposed to acquire Star-
link’s downlink signals. A Kalman-ﬁlter-based algorithm for tracking
the Doppler frequency from the unknown Starlink signals is devel-
oped. Experimental results show Doppler tracking of six Starlink
satellites, achieving a horizontal positioning error of 10 m.

INTRODUCTION
Theoreticalandexperimentalstudieshavedemonstrated
the potential of low Earth orbit (LEO) broadband
communication satellites as promising reliable sources
for navigation [1]–[4]. Companies like Amazon, Telesat,
and SpaceX are deploying so-called megaconstellations
to provide global broadband internet [5]. In particular,
launching thousands of space vehicles (SVs) into LEO by
SpaceX can be considered as a turning point in the future of
LEO-based navigation technologies. Although they suffer
from higher Doppler effect, signals received from LEO
SVs can be about 30 dB stronger than signals received from
medium Earth orbit (MEO) SVs, where global navigation
satellite systems (GNSSs) SVs reside [4].
Research has shown that one could exploit LEO SV
broadband communication signals opportunistically for
navigation purposes [3]. Three of the main challenges of
navigation with Starlink SV signals are as follows:
1) Limited information about the signal structure.
2) Very-high dynamics of Starlink LEO SVs.
3) Poorly known ephemerides.
Assuming that Starlink LEO SV downlink signals con-
tains a periodic reference signal, this letter tackles the ﬁrst

challenge by formulating a matched subspace detection
problem to detect the unknown RS of Starlink SVs and
estimate the unknown period and Doppler frequency. The
second challenge is addressed by adopting a second-order
model to capture the dynamics of the Doppler frequency,
and designing a Kalman ﬁlter (KF)-based algorithm that
is capable of tracking the unknown parameters of the
Doppler model. A blind approach was presented in [6]
and [7] to exploit partially known signals for navigation
purposes. However, these approaches were designed for
M-ary phase-shift keying signaling and are incapable of
deciphering sophisticated signals, such as Starlink’s orthog-
onal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) signals.
This letter makes the following contributions. First,
a model for the Starlink LEO SV’s downlink signals is
presented. Second, an algorithm is proposed to acquire the
Starlink LEO SV signals and track the Doppler frequency
of each detected SV. Third, next to [8], the ﬁrst experimen-
tal positioning results with Starlink downlink signals are
presented in this letter. In [8], an adaptive KF is used to
track the carrier phase of Starlink LEO SVs. However, the
method presented in [8] relies on tracking the phase of a
single carrier. When a more complicated signal structure
is used in the downlink signal, e.g., OFDMA, a more
sophisticated method should be developed to exploit the
entire signal bandwidth for navigation purposes. Indeed,
the method in [8] is not capable of exploiting the entire
signal bandwidth, and it only relies on tracking a single
frequency component. In this letter, by considering a gen-
eral model for the Starlink downlink signals, the unknown
parameters of the signal are estimated for the ﬁrst time for
Starlink LEO SVs, and are subsequently used to detect the
Starlink LEO SVs and track their corresponding Doppler
frequencies. The proposed method enables one to estimate
the synchronization signals of the Starlink LEO SVs.

RECEIVED SIGNAL MODEL
A.
Starlink Downlink Signals
Except for the carrier frequencies and the bandwidths,
more detailed signal speciﬁcations of Starlink downlink sig-
nals are unavailable to the public. SpaceX uses the Ku-band
spectrum for the satellite-to-user links (both uplink and
downlink) and the satellite-to-ground contacts are carried
out in Ka-band [9]. Software-deﬁned radios (SDRs) allow
one to sample bands of the radio frequency spectrum. How-
ever, Ku/Ka-bands are beyond the carrier frequency of most
commercial SDRs. Hence, in the experiments carried out in
this letter, a 10-GHz mixer is employed between the antenna
and the SDR to downconvert Starlink LEO SV signals from
11.325 GHz to 1.325 GHz.
In order to formulate a detection problem to detect
the activity of Starlink downlink signals, a signal model
is proposed that solely relies on the periodicity of the
transmitted signals. The logic behind the proposed signal
model is that in most commercial communication systems,
a periodic RS is transmitted for synchronization purposes,
e.g., primary synchronization signals (PSSs) in long-term
evolution (LTE) and the ﬁfth generation (5G) signals. The
following subsection presents a model for the Starlink LEO
SV’s downlink signals.
B.
Baseband Signal Model
As mentioned previously, in most commercial commu-
nication systems, a periodic RS is transmitted, e.g., PSS
in OFDMA-based and spreading codes in code division
multiple access-based signals. In this letter, the Starlink
LEO SV downlink signal is modeled as an unknown pe-
riodic signal in the presence of interference and noise. If
an RS, such as PSS in OFDMA-based signals, is being
periodically transmitted, it will be detected and estimated
by the proposed method. The received baseband signal is
modeled as
r[n] = αc[τn −ts[n]] exp

jθ[τn]

+ d[τn −ts[n]] exp

jθ[τn]

+ w[n]
(1)
where r[n] is the received signal at the nth time instant; α
is the complex channel gain between the receiver and the
Starlink LEO SV; τn is the sample time expressed in the
receiver time; c[τn] represents the samples of the complex
periodic RS with a period of L samples; ts[n] is the code-
delay between the receiver and the Starlink LEO SV at the
nth time instant; θ[τn] = 2π fD[n]Tsn is the carrier phase in
radians, where fD[n] is the instantaneous Doppler frequency
at the nth time instant and Ts is the sampling time; di[τn]
represents the complex samples of some data transmitted
from the Starlink LEO SV; and w[n] is measurement noise,
which is modeled as a complex, zero-mean, independent,
and identically distributed random sequence with variance
σ 2
w.
Starlink LEO SV’s signals suffer from very high
Doppler shifts. Higher lengths of processing intervals re-
quire higher order Doppler models. In order for a Doppler
estimation algorithm to provide an accurate estimate of
the Doppler frequency, the processing interval should be
large enough to accumulate enough power. According to the
considered processing interval length in the experiments, it
was observed that during the kth processing interval, the
instantaneous Doppler frequency is nearly a linear function
of time, i.e., fD[n] = fDk + βkn, where fDk is referred to
as constant Doppler, and βk is the Doppler rate at the kth
processing interval. The coherent processing interval (CPI)
is deﬁned as the time interval in which the constant Doppler,
fDk, and the Doppler rate, βk, are constant.
The received signal at the nth time instant when
the Doppler rate is wiped-off is denoted by r′[n] ≜
exp(−j2πβkn2)r[n]. One can deﬁne the desired RS which
is going to be detected in the acquisition stage as

Hence, r′[n] = s[n] + weq[n]. Due to the periodicity of the

formed as

PROPOSED FRAMEWORK
This section presents the structure of the proposed
framework. The proposed receiver consists of two main
stages: (i) acquisition and (ii) tracking. In the acquisition
stage, an estimate of the period of the RS in the Downlink
signal of Starlink SV, and an initial estimate for the Doppler
parameters are provided at k = 0, which is discussed in
the following subsection. In order for the receiver to reﬁne
and maintain the Doppler estimate, a tracking stage is also
presented.
A.
Acquisition
In this section, a detection scheme is proposed to detect
the existence of Starlink LEO SVs in the carrier frequency
of 11.325 GHz within a bandwidth of 2.5 MHz, at k = 0.
The following binary hypothesis test is used to detect the
Starlink LEO SV signal

H0:
y0 = weq0
H1:
y0 = H0s + weq0.
(9)
For a given set of unknown variables W0 = {L, ω0, β0}, the
generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) detector for the testing
hypothesis (9) is known as matched subspace detector [10],
[11], and is derived as (see [12, Th. 9.1])

matrix onto the space orthogonal to the column space of H0,
and η is the threshold, which is predetermined according to
the probability of false alarm. Since, HH
k Hk = MIL for all
k, the likelihood L(y0|W0) can be rewritten as L(y0|W0) =

∥y0∥2

M2 ∥HH

where η′ is determined according to a desired probability

ˆ
W0 = argmaxL,ω0,β0∥HH
0 y0∥2.
(12)
It should be pointed out that the estimated Doppler using
(12) results in a constant ambiguity denoted by ωa = 2π fa.
This constant ambiguity is accounted for the navigation
ﬁlter.
Fig. 1 demonstrates the likelihood in terms of Doppler
frequency and the period for real Starlink downlink signals.
The CPI was set to be 200 times the period. As it can
be seen in Fig. 1, a Starlink LEO SV downlink signal is
detectedwithaperiodof32μsandataDopplerfrequencyof
−2745 Hz.
B.
Doppler Tracking Algorithm
It is important to note that the receiver does not have
knowledge of the Doppler ambiguity fa. The Doppler fre-
quency that will be tracked by the receiver contains this con-
stant ambiguity. In order to track the Doppler, a KF-based
tracking loop is developed. The KF formulation allows for
arbitrary Doppler model order selection, which is crucial
due to the LEO SVs’ high dynamics. The KF-based Doppler
tracking algorithm is described as follows.
1) Doppler Dynamics Model: The time-varying com-
ponent of the continuous-time true Doppler, denoted by
f (t), is a function of (i) the true range rate between the
LEO SV and the receiver, denoted by ˙d(t), and the (ii)
time-varying difference between the receiver’s and LEO
SV’s clock bias rate, denoted by ˙b(t), expressed in meters

˙d(t)
λ +

λ + fa], where,
ω(t) = 2π f (t), and λ is the carrier wavelength. The clock
bias is assumed to have a constant drift, i.e., b(t) = a · (t −
t0) + b0, where a is the clock drift, b is the constant bias, and
t0 is the initial time. Moreover, simulations with Starlink
LEO SVs show that the kinematic model ...
d (t) = ˜w(t),
where ˜w is a zero-mean white noise process with power
spectral density q ˜w holds for short periods of time. Let
k denote the time index corresponding to tk = kT + t0,
where T = MLTs is the sampling interval also known as
subaccumulation period, and ML is the number of subaccu-
mulated samples. The vector ωk ≜[ωk, ˙ωk]T is considered
as the Doppler state vector for the proposed tracking algo-
rithm. The initial state is given by ω0 = [2π fa + 2π
λ (a −
˙d(t0)), −2π
λ ¨d(t0)]T.
2) KF-Based Doppler Tracking: Let ˆωk|l and Pk|l de-
note the KF estimate of ωk and corresponding estimation
error covariance, respectively, given all measurements up to
time-step l ≤k. The initial estimate ˆω0|0 with a correspond-
ing P0|0 are provided from the acquisition stage. The KF-
based tracking algorithm follows a regular KF for the time
update. The measurement update is discussed next. The KF
measurement update equations are carried out based on the
maximum likelihood estimate of the Doppler. The Doppler
wipe-off is performed as ˜rk[i] = r[i + kML] exp[−j ˆθk+i|k],
where ˆθk+i|k is obtained according to ˆθk+i|k = ˆωk|kiTs +

structed as ˜yk+1 = [˜rk[0], . . . , ˜rk[ML −1]]T. One can show
that [cf. (7)]
˜yk+1 = ˜Hk+1s + ˜weqk+1
(13)
where the residual Doppler matrix is

is given by

(15)
which is a direct measure of the Doppler error. The mea-
surement noise is chosen proportional to the Doppler search
step size. The initial estimates of the Doppler ˆω0|0 and the
Doppler rate ˆ˙ω0|0 are obtained from the acquisition stage.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section provides the ﬁrst results for blind Doppler
tracking and positioning with Starlink signals of opportu-
nity. A stationary National Instrument (NI) universal soft-
ware radio peripheral (USRP) 2945R was equipped with
a consumer-grade Ku antenna and low-noise block (LNB)
downconverter to receive Starlink signals in the Ku-band.
The sampling rate was set to 2.5 MHz and the carrier
frequency was set to 11.325 GHz, which is one of the
Starlink downlink frequencies. The samples of the Ku signal

were stored for ofﬂine processing. The tracking results are
presented next.
A.
Blind Doppler Tracking Results
The USRP was set to record Ku signals over a period
of 800 s. During this period, a total of six Starlink SVs
transmitting at 11.325 GHz passed over the receiver, one at
a time. The framework discussed in Section III was used
to acquire the downlink signals and track the Doppler fre-
quencies and rates from these LEO SVs, which are shown in
Fig. 2 along with the ones predicted from two-line element
(TLE) ﬁles [3]. It can be seen that the proposed algorithm
is tracking the Doppler and the Doppler rate of six Starlink
LEO SVs. It can also be seen that the estimated Doppler
frequencies have a constant bias compared to the predicted
ones from the TLEs.
B.
Position Estimation
Next, pseudorange rate observables are formed from
the tracked Doppler frequencies by downsampling by a
factor D to avoid large time correlations in the pseudo-
range observables and multiplying by the wavelength to
express the Doppler frequencies in meters per second. Let
i ∈{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} denote the SV index. The pseudorange
rate observable to the ith SV at time step κ = k · D, ex-
pressed in meters, is modeled as

where rr and rSVi(κ) are the receiver’s and ith Starlink SV 3-
D position vectors, ˙rSVi(κ) is the ith Starlink SV 2-D veloc-
ity vector, ai is the constant bias due to the unknown Doppler
frequency ambiguity fa, and vzi(κ) is the measurement
noise, which is modeled as a zero-mean, white Gaussian
random variable with variance σ 2

together, and let vz denote the vector of all measurement
noises stacked together, which is a zero-mean Gaussian
randomvectorwithadiagonalcovariance R whosediagonal
elements are given by σ 2
i (κ). Then, one can readily write
the measurement equation given by z = g(x) + vz, where
g(x) is a vector-valued function that maps the parameter x
to the pseudorange rate observables according to (16). Next,
a weighted nonlinear least-squares (WNLS) estimator with
weight matrix R−1 is solved to obtain an estimate of x given
by ˆx = [ˆrT
r , ˆa1, . . . , ˆa6]T. The SV positions were obtained
from TLE ﬁles and SGP4 software. It is important to note
thattheTLEepochtimewasadjustedforeachSVtoaccount
for ephemeris errors. This was achieved by minimizing the
pseudorange rate residuals for each SV.
Subsequently, the receiver position was estimated using
the aforementioned WNLS. The 3-D position error was
found to be 22.9 m, while the 2-D position error was
10 m. A skyplot of the Starlink SVs and the environ-
ment layout summarizing the positioning results are shown
in Fig. 3.

CONCLUSION
This letter showed the ﬁrst Doppler tracking and posi-
tioning results with real Starlink LEO SV signals. A model
of a Starlink SV’s received signal and a detection problem
to detect Starlink downlink SV signals were formulated.
A KF-based Doppler tracking algorithm was developed to
track the Doppler of Starlink downlink signals. Experimen-
tal results showed carrier phase tracking of six Starlink
LEO SVs over a period of approximately 800 s. The ex-
periments also show a 10-m 2-D and 22.9-m 3-D position
errors.
