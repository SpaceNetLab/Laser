Abstract—Cooperative positioning with multiple low earth orbit
(LEO) satellites is promising in providing location-based services
and enhancing satellite-terrestrial communication. However, po-
sitioning accuracy is greatly affected by inter-beam interference
and satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. To select the best com-
bination of satellites from visible ones and suppress inter-beam
interference, this paper explores the utilization of ﬂexible beam
scheduling and beamforming of multi-beam LEO satellites that can
adjust beam directions toward the same earth-ﬁxed cell to send po-
sitioning signals simultaneously. By leveraging Cramér-Rao lower
bound (CRLB) to characterize user Time Difference of Arrival
(TDOA) positioning accuracy, the concerned problem is formu-
lated, aiming at optimizing user positioning accuracy under beam
scheduling and beam transmission power constraints. To deal with
the mixed-integer-nonconvex problem, we decompose it into an
inner beamforming design problem and an outer beam scheduling
problem. For the former, we ﬁrst prove the monotonic relationship
between user positioning accuracy and its perceived signal-to-
interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to reformulate the problem,
and then semideﬁnite relaxation (SDR) is adopted for beamforming
design. For the outer problem, a heuristic low-complexity beam
scheduling scheme is proposed, whose core idea is to schedule users
with lower channel correlation to mitigate inter-beam interference
while seeking a proper satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. Sim-
ulation results verify the superior positioning performance of our
proposed positioning-oriented beamforming and beam scheduling
scheme, and it is shown that average user positioning accuracy
is improved by 17.1% and 55.9% when the beam transmission
power is 20 dBw, compared to conventional beamforming and beam
scheduling schemes, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION
W
ITH the evolution of small satellite platform manufac-
ture and space launch technology, dense LEO satel-
lite constellations will come into being, such as Starlink and
OneWeb [1], [2]. In such constellations, multiple LEO satel-
lites can simultaneously cover a ground user, which facil-
itates providing more enhanced services, including satellite
edge computing [3] and high precision user positioning [4].
For the latter, multiple satellites can send positioning sig-
nals to the same user or cell to improve Geometric Dilu-
tion of Precision (GDOP), convergence speed, and pseudo-
range measurement accuracy, where cooperative satellite beam
scheduling and beamforming design are the fundamental
issues.
Owing to the development of software-deﬁned payloads,
satelliteonboardcommunicationresourcescanbescheduledand
conﬁgured on demand. An LEO satellite can ﬂexibly adjust the
serving relationship between beams and earth-ﬁxed cells [5],
following a speciﬁc time-space transmission plan. Such ﬂexi-
bility in beam scheduling enables a good match between limited
network resources and heterogeneous service demands, thereby
greatly enhancing system utility [6], [7]. The design of beam
scheduling usually involves binary variables, which makes the
problem fall into the category of integer programming that is
difﬁcult to solve. The authors of [8] made use of the Semi-
Deﬁnite Programming (SDP) technique and presented a heuris-
tic algorithm to provide a solution rapidly. Aiming to achieve
global optimal beam scheduling, the authors of [9] employed a
simulated annealing method at the expense of high computation
complexity. Considering the unknown dynamics of the satellite
communication environment, a model-free deep reinforcement
learning-based approach was proposed to learn the optimal beam
scheduling plan [10]. However, these previous works ignore the
potential co-frequency interference among beams. To further re-
duce the inter-beam interference, literature [11] provided a novel
joint beam scheduling and SVD-based beamforming approach
to suppress inter-beam interference. The authors in [12], [13],
[14] adopted SDR to reformulate the co-channel interference
suppression problem and conducted successive convex approxi-
mation (SCA) to optimize the beamformer. In a similar vein,
the authors in [3] adopted Lyapunov optimization theory to
solve the problems of binary association and beamforming to

maximize the data rate. Moreover, literature [8] jointly
considered beam scheduling design and Zero Forcing (ZF)
beamforming under per feed power constraint at the satellite.
The above works on satellite beam scheduling and beam-
forming mainly focus on satisfying user communication de-
mands. However, multi-beam LEO satellite systems need to
take advantage of positioning and provide positioning informa-
tion services in the future [15]. Compared with GNSS, which
relies on satellites mainly operating in medium earth orbits,
the free space loss with LEO satellites is much lower. The
received power on the ground can be improved by more than
30 dB under the same transmission power [16], which makes
it easier for us to capture and track positioning signals. Apart
from providing location-based services, position information
is also essential for enhancing communication services. In the
physical layer, positioning information can be used for improv-
ing carrier frequency offset estimation in uplink orthogonal
frequency division multiple access systems [17]. In the net-
working layer, a user terminal (UT) can leverage its position
information to trigger a handover procedure between satellites
actively [18].
A well-known methodology for positioning is the time dif-
ference of arrival (TDOA) technique [19]. In this paradigm, a
UT calculates the difference between the times at which the
signals of a pair of satellites arrive at the UT. For each pair
of satellites, TDOA provides a hyperbolic map plot of possible
UT positions [20]. Each additional satellite pair provides an-
other intersecting hyperbola, further reﬁning the UT position.
To assess TDOA performance [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], the
metric for benchmarking any unbiased estimators, CRLB, is
generally used. There has been some research on optimizing
TDOA positioning performance by beamforming and beam
scheduling in terrestrial and satellite networks. The authors
of [26] optimized beamforming vectors at base stations (BSs) to
minimize the power expenditure under data rate and positioning
accuracy constraints, where multiple BSs with multiple antennas
communicate with multiple single-antenna UTs. Literature [27]
proposed a method to decrease the overlap of estimated positions
as well as increase the accuracy of TDOA positioning by using
beamforming at BSs. In LEO satellite systems, the authors
of [28] investigated the beam scheduling problem and designed
a novel beam hopping framework to optimize positioning per-
formance.
Overall,thejointdesignofbeamformingandbeamscheduling
for positioning in multi-beam LEO satellite systems still needs
to be explored, which is technically challenging for several
reasons. First, with the number of visible satellites increasing,
it becomes intractable to quickly select serving satellites for
UTs/cells to maximize positioning accuracy. Second, consider-
ing full frequency reuse (FFR) among satellite beams [29], [30],
inter-beam interference becomes critical, and the radio ranging
measurement accuracy can signiﬁcantly degrade as SINR gets
lower. Third, mitigating inter-beam interference also imposes
higherrequirementsonbeamschedulingdesign,andmeanwhile,
proper satellite-terrestrial topology geometry should also be
formed by beam schedule. Our main contributions are summa-
rized as follows.

SYMBOL SUMMARY
r A novel multi-beam LEO satellite network scenario for co-
operative UT positioning is considered, where each satel-
lite can generate multiple beams using a planar antenna
array, and each UT can receive positioning signals sent by
beams from numerous satellites. Using CRLB to character-
ize the TDOA positioning accuracy of a single UT, we for-
mulate the problem of joint satellite beam scheduling and
beamforming design, aiming at optimizing UT positioning
accuracy under per-beam transmission power constraint
and the constraint on the number of serving beams for each
UT.
r To deal with the non-convex mixed-integer problem, it is
decomposed into an inner beamforming design problem
and an outer beam scheduling problem. For the former, we
proposeaUTSINRthresholdadjustment basedbeamform-
ing algorithm with the SDR technique, which is inspired
by the monotonic relationship between the positioning
accuracy of a single UT and its perceived SINR. For the
latter, a fast and efﬁcient greedy heuristic beam scheduling
algorithm that changes the value of a 0-1 variable from 0
to 1 in each round of iteration is developed, considering
the trade-off between channel correlation and UT-satellite
topology geometry.
r Extensive numerical evaluations are carried out, where our
proposal is compared with conventional beamforming and
GDOP-based beam scheduling schemes under different
beam transmission powers and the numbers of visible
satellites. It is shown that average user positioning accuracy
can be improved by 17.1% and 55.9%, respectively.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents the system model and the concerned positioning ac-
curacy optimization problem. Section III details the design of
the beamforming algorithm. In Section IV, the beam scheduling
problem is solved. Simulation results are given in Section V,
and the conclusion is drawn in Section VI. Essential symbols
are summarized in Table I.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. System Model
The LEO satellite communication system scenario for coop-
erative UT positioning is shown in Fig. 1. To realize centralized
control and coordinate satellites, if the reference satellite has
powerful computing capability and connects to other satel-
lites through inter-satellite links (ISLs), the positioning-oriented
beam scheduling and beamforming algorithms are executed at
this satellite, whose results are fed back to other satellites via
ISLs. Otherwise, the gateway (GW), covering the cooperative
LEO satellites simultaneously, is responsible for executing these
algorithms and forwards the results to satellites via feeder links.
Each satellite is equipped with a uniform planar array (UPA)
composed of N = NxNy antennas, where Nx and Ny are the
numbers of antennas on the x and y axis, respectively, and it
is assumed that each satellite can generate at most K beams.
By sending positioning signals on time-frequency resource
that is orthogonal to the resource used for normal communi-
cation services, multiple satellites can cooperatively provide
UT positioning capability. There are multiple single-antenna
UTs distributed in C earth-ﬁxed cells whose set is denoted by
C = {1, 2, . . ., C}, and denote the set of LEO satellites visible
to the cells by I = {1, 2, . . ., I}. Further, it is assumed that
there is one UT in each cell for simplicity, and hence we use
UT c to represent the UT located in cell c in the following.
Deﬁne δi,c = 1 if satellite i schedules a beam to serve UT c, and
δi,c = 0 otherwise. The set of satellites serving UT c and the
set of UTs served by satellite i are denoted as Ic = {i|δi,c = 1}
and Ci = {c|δi,c = 1}, respectively.
The beamforming vector of satellite i for UT c is denoted as
wi,c ∈CN×1 and the collection of all beamforming vectors is
denoted as Wi ∈CN×|Ci|. Then, the discrete-time transmitted
navigation signal of satellite i is therefore given by xi = Wini,
where ni is the |Ci| × 1 symbol vector consisting of the navi-
gation signal ni,c for UT c with E


i

= I|Ci|. Suppose that
proper frequency reuse is utilized among satellites so there is
no inter-satellite interference. In contrast, intra-satellite interfer-
ence exists due to full frequency reuse among beams of the same
satellite. Therefore, the received signal of UT c from satellite i
is given by
yi,c = hT
i,cwi,cni,c +

c′∈Ci,c′̸=c

and UT c, and ˆyi,c ∼N

is white Gaussian noise. Then,
the SINR of UT c when receiving the positioning signal from
satellite i is given by

|hT
i,cwi,c|2

c′∈Ci,c′̸=c |hT
i,cwi,c′|2 + ϵ2c
,
i ∈Ic.
(2)
Considering the clock asynchronous problem, the signal from
a reference satellite is used as the reference measurement for all
UTs. With the knowledge of satellite positions acquired from
the ephemeris, UTs use TDOA measurements for positioning.
Speciﬁcally, UT c uses the signal from satellite i ∈Ic to estimate
time of arrival (TOA) and calculates the time difference between
TOAs of satellite i and the reference satellite. Then, UT c esti-
mates its own position with the observation equations of TDOA.
According to [21], [31], for UT c and satellite i, the CRLB of
TOA measurement under an AWGN channel is calculated by
σ2
i,c =
3
4π2B2SINRi,c
,
(3)
where B is the bandwidth of satellite i’s beam [32].
Denote the positions of UT c, satellites i and the refer-
ence satellite as sc = [xc, yc, zc]T , si = [xi, yi, zi]T and s0 =
[x0, y0, z0]T , respectively. Then, the distance di,c between satel-
lite i and UT c can be expressed as
di,c = ∥sc −si∥2.
(4)
Thus, UT c can get TDOA measurements for satellite i and the
reference satellite as
TDOAi,c = 1
v (di,c −d0,c) + (TOAi,c −TOA0,c)
= Gi,c(sc) + (TOAi,c −TOA0,c),

v(di,c(sc) −d0,c(sc)),
TOAi,c and TOA0,c are the TOA measurement and TOAi,c ∼

ence satellite, TDOA measurements are correlated. Denote

The measurement equation for the measurement vector TDOAc
is given by

(6)
where Gc(sc) = [Gi1,c(sc), Gi2,c(sc), . . . , Gi|Ic|,c(sc),c]T .

B. Channel Model
Particularly, the free space path loss is considered to construct
the channel model. According to [12], [13], [14], the channel
vector from satellite i to UT c is modeled as
hi,c =

(8)
where θi,c is the phase vector with uniform distribution over
[0, 2π), Li,c is the free space loss given by
Li,c(dB) = 20lg(f) + 20lg(di,c) + 32.4,
(9)
and vi,c is the UPA response vector. Based on [34], the UPA
response vector vi,c can be further calculated as

C. Problem Formulation
The positioning-oriented beam scheduling and beamforming
design is formulated as the following problem, aiming to opti-
mize UT TDOA positioning accuracy, which is given by

(11)
where Fc = CRLBc. Constraint C1 states that each satellite
can generate at most K beams simultaneously due to limited
hardwarecapability.ConstraintC2 ensuresthateachUTreceives
positioning signals from ITDOA beams from different satellites
alongsidethereferencesatellite.ConstraintC3 meansδi,c isa0-1

constraint, and wi,c is an all-zero column vector of dimension
N when δi,c = 0.
III. DYNAMIC UT SINR THRESHOLD ADJUSTMENT BASED
SATELLITE BEAMFORMING
In (11), we seek to ﬁnd beamforming design {wi,c} and beam
scheduling plan {δi,c} that optimize user positioning accuracy.
Unfortunately, ﬁnding a globally optimal solution in polynomial
time is impossible due to the non-convex objective function and
mixed-integer structure. To make the problem more tractable, in
thissection,weﬁrstdealwithpositioning-orientedbeamforming

In the following proposition, we ﬁrst highlight the intrin-
sic relationship between UT’s positioning accuracy and UT’s
perceived SINR from a single satellite to guide beamforming
algorithm design.

where satellite i is thei-th satellite in set Ic serving UT c, Ac is a
column full rank matrix with probability one and Rc is positive
deﬁnite.
Proof: First, we leverage Fig. 2 to prove that Ac is a column
full rank matrix with probability one when |Ic| = 3 by contra-
diction. As shown in Fig. 2, O, i0, i1, i2, i3 are the positions of
UT c, the reference satellite and satellite i1, i2, i3. O0, O1, O2, O3
are the intersection points of line Oi0, Oi1, Oi2, Oi3 with the
unit sphere whose center is O, respectively. The satellites
are assumed to be distributed in sphere P1 following a two-
dimensional distribution with a probability density function.
Since the column of AT
c , ai,c = sc−si
di,c −sc−s0
d0,c , represents the
difference between the unit vectors pointing to satellite i and
the reference satellite from UT, i.e. −−→
OOi −−−→
OO0, a1,c, a2,c and
a3,c correspond to −−−→
O0O1, −−−→
O0O2 and −−−→
O0O3, respectively. If Ac
is not a full rank matrix, a3,c can be represented as a linear
combination of a1,c and a2,c, which means −−−→
O0O3 should lie in
plane P2 which is spanned by −−−→
O0O1 and −−−→
O0O2. As −−→
OO3 is a
unit vector, O3 should lie in circle L1, the intersecting curve of
the unit sphere and plane P2. Further, as O3 is the intersection
point of the line Oi3 with the unit sphere, we can conclude that
the point i3 falls on circle L2, the projection of circle L1 onto
sphere P1 on the basis of O. However, the probability that the
point i3 falls onto circle L2 is zero because the probability equals
the integration of a 2-dimensional probability density function
over the 1-dimensional curve. Since a contradiction occurs, the
assumption that Ac is not a full rank matrix does not hold.
Similarly, we can select 3 linearly independent columns from
AT
c to prove that rank(Ac) = 3 when |I| > 3, which means Ac
is a column full rank matrix.
Next, we show that Rc is positive deﬁnite. Rc in (7) can be
re-written as Rc = Uc + Vc as follows:
Uc =
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

The eigenvalues of Uc and Vc equal σ2
0,c, 0, . . . , 0 and
σ2
i1,c, σ2
i2,c, . . . , σ2
i|Ic|,c, respectively. Applying the Rayleigh-

|I|-dimensional vector x, 0 ≤xHUcx

which means Rc is positive deﬁnite.
Further, to derive the closed-form expression of
∂Fc
∂SINRi,c , we
deﬁne σ2
i,c = σ2
i,c + Δ2. Accordingly, Fc and Rc change to
Fc and Rc, respectively. Denote vi = [0, . . . , Δ, . . . , 0]T as a
vector where only thei-th component equals Δ and all the others
are zero. Then, using the fact that
(X + xyT )−1 = X−1 −X−1xyT X−1
1 + yT X−1x
for any vector x, y ∈C|I|×1 and non-singular matrix X, the
expression of Rc can be written as

Proposition 1 reveals the monotonic relationship between UT
SINR of receiving the signal sent by one beam and its positioning
accuracy under a speciﬁc UT-satellite-topology, and it inspires
us to gradually improve SINRi,c to enhance overall positioning
performance. To this end, we deﬁne γi,c as the threshold for
SINRi,c, i.e. γi,c ≤SINRi,c, and successively raise γi,c with
equal step size. Speciﬁcally, we raise up γi,c for one UT based
on the derived gradient (17) as
γi,c = γi,c + γ0, c = arg min

For each update, the following problem is solved to check
whether the new {γi,c}c∈Ci is feasible.

If t∗≥1, it is feasible and we can continue to raise γi,c with
(18), while t∗< 1 otherwise.
Note that problem (19) can be well solved by SDR [37], [38]
by converting it into the following form:

where H′i,c = hi,chH
i,c, Qi,c = wi,cwH
i,c, and the only non-
convex constraint rank(Qi,c) = 1 can be relaxed. In this way,
problem (20) can be solved as a general convex optimization
problem. The results of the original problem(19) can be obtained
by applying rank-one approximation based on the results of
problem (20) via w∗
i,c =

λ∗b∗, where λ∗and b∗are the the
largest eigenvalue and respective eigenvector of Q∗

tively.
Our basic description of dynamic UT SINR threshold adjust-
ment (DSTA) based beamforming algorithm is now complete,
whose detail is summarized in Algorithm 1, which assumes
T different values for γi,c with an equal step size. Compared
with the algorithm in [38], which has the same search space
size, Algorithm 1 reduces the number of iterations from KT to
K · T. In addition, the SDR technique can be used to produce
an approximated solution to (20) with a complexity of O((N ·
K)3.5) [37]. Since we need to adjust the SINR threshold γi,c at
most O(K · T) times with (17), the overall time complexity of
Algorithm 1 is no more than O(N 3.5 · K4.5 · T) for each satel-
lite, which is polynomial in N.

Considering the coupling of beam scheduling and beamform-
ing design, a straightforward way to solve the above problem
is to design a two-layer iterative algorithm, where the outer
layer optimizes beam scheduling while the inner layer optimizes
beamforming under ﬁxed beam scheduling with our proposed
DSTA-based beamforming algorithm. The outer layer solves a
0-1 programming, and particle swarm optimization or branch-
and-bound method can be adopted. Nevertheless, such a design
can incur high complexity, which is undesirable for practi-
cal implementation. Hence, in this paper, a fast and efﬁcient
beam scheduling algorithm is designed, which decouples beam
scheduling from beamforming and only relies on channel state
information and satellite ephemeris. To guide the design, we ﬁrst

Since Rc can be written as (Vc + σ2

[1, . . . , 1]T , using the fact that
(X + xyT )−1 = X−1 −X−1xyT X−1

Proposition 2 gives an approximation of UT positioning ac-
curacy and further reveals its intrinsic relationship with beam
scheduling result indicated by Ic that is the set of satellites
serving UT c. On the one hand, beam scheduling inﬂuences
inter-beam/inter-user interference and hence σ2
i,c via SINRi,c.
On the other hand, beam scheduling directly determines the
relative positions among UTs and satellites, which impacts
ai,c. Inspired by these observations, a low-complexity heuris-
tic beam scheduling algorithm is designed incorporating two
steps.
In the ﬁrst step, we focus on degrading inter-UT interference
to achieve higher SINRi,c, and the following metric ρi,c is
deﬁned to measure the similarity between hi,c and the elements
in {hi,c′}c′∈Ci, which is given by
ρi,c =

Such metric is originally derived for ZF beamforming to ﬁnd
the users with minimum mutual interference [38].

ingonFc viaai,c,andthemetricμi,c isdeﬁnedtocoarselyreﬂect

where λr(X) denotes the r-th eigenvalue of X. To reduce the
complexity of computing the eigenvalues in (28), we further
design a fast method for calculating μi,c.
Suppose the eigenvalue decomposition of 
i∈Ic ai,caT
i,c is
R

r , where R, λr, br are the rank, eigenvalues and

Based on the above metric, instead of ﬁnding the optimal
beam scheduling iteratively, we only need to ﬁnd a beam
scheduling plan that satisﬁes the constraints of (21) and provides
good channel orthogonality and UT-satellite-topology geome-
try. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst greedily select m candidate satellites
for each UT in each iteration according to the principle of
minimizing channel similarity ρi,c. Then, with the principle of
maximizing μi,c, a satellite is ﬁnally selected to provide service
for UT c. Finally, Ic and Ci are updated. The summary of the
proposed heuristic beam scheduling (HBS) algorithm is given in
Algorithm 2, whose complexity is O(C · ITDOA · I · K).
Overall, we design a low-complexity joint beamforming and
beam scheduling algorithm with the help of Proposition 1 and
Proposition 2, which essentially reveal the correlation of posi-
tioning performance with SINR and GDOP. Compared with the
genetic algorithms [39], HBS-DSTA need not feed the output
of the beamformer back to the scheduler with the complexity of
O(I · N 3.5 · K4.5 · T) + O(C · ITDOA · I · K).
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
This section presents simulation results to verify the perfor-
mance of the proposed DSTA-based beamforming and beam
scheduling algorithms. We choose three beamforming algo-
rithms for comparison as below.
r ZF based beamforming [40]: ZF beamforming eliminates
the co-channel interference (CCI) term in (2) caused
by frequency reuse among beams. Denoting the matrix
of channel by Hi = [hi,c1, . . . , hi,c|Ci|]H ∈C|Ci|×N, the
beamforming weight matrix Wi of satellite i is calculated
by

(34)
r Single-cell beamforming without interference (SCBWI):
For comparison, we consider an ideal scenario where
inter-beam interference is completely ignored and wi,c is
calculated the same as SCB. Since each UT SINR reaches
the theoretical maximum, individual positioning accuracy
is also the best, according to Proposition 1. Therefore, we
use it as the ideal upper bound of the positioning accuracy.
At this time, SINRi,c is reduced to SNRi,c that is calculated
by
SNRi,c = |hT

In the baseline schemes for beam scheduling, we have
compared the proposed HBS algorithm with the GDOP-based
scheduling scheme [41], the communication-oriented beam
scheduling scheme [38], and the parallax-based scheduling
scheme [42].

Note that GDOPc can also be calculated by converting it
into the form with regard to the eigenvalues of Ac. With
the proposed method (31), GDOPc can be fast computed.
Meanwhile, the GDOP-based beam scheduling is a partic-
ular case of our proposed beam scheduling algorithm if we
set m = |I|.
r Communication-oriented scheduling: In communication-
oriented scheduling, satellites are continuously and greed-
ily selected from I to minimize ρi,c until there are
ITDOA satellites providing service for UT c. Meanwhile,
communication-oriented scheduling is a special case of
HBS if we set m = 1.

parallax-based scheduling, we continuously delete satellite

elements of the matrix Pc corresponding to the removed
satellite until there are ITDOA satellites remaining.
Key simulation parameters are summarized in Table II, where
we set the number of satellites I visible to the ground user to
16, 21, 26 with the corresponding number of satellites/beams
serving each UT being 3, 4, 5.
A. The Effectiveness of DSTA-Based Beamforming
When ITDOA = 4, the cumulative distribution functions
(CDFs) of UT positioning accuracy under different beamform-
ing schemes are shown in Fig. 3, where the proposed HBS
is adopted with m = 4 for all the schemes. It can be found

that DSTA-based beamforming achieves higher positioning ac-
curacy than the other schemes employing positioning-oriented
beamforming. As shown in Table III, the average positioning
accuracyofDSTA-basedbeamformingisaround9.54minterms
of CRLB. It signiﬁcantly outperforms ZF and SCB by 11.9%
and 51.1%, respectively. In addition, the performance of our
proposed scheme is just within a small gap from the version of
SCBWI.
The CDFs of UT SINR under four beamforming schemes
are drawn in Fig. 4 to give more insight into the superior

performance of our proposal. Notably, it indicates a signiﬁcant
improvement brought by DSTA in SINR distribution compared
to ZF and SCB schemes, and there is only a 1–3 dB perfor-
mance loss compared to SCBWI. Meanwhile, the stepped curve
with DSTA-based beamforming is because we raise the SINR
threshold by ﬁxed value γ0 each time.
B. The Impact of Beam Transmission Power Budget on the
Performance of DSTA-Based Beamforming
In Fig. 5, the performance of the DSTA-based beamforming
scheme is evaluated with ITDOA = 4 under various satellite
transmission power budgets. It can be found that the positioning
accuracy performance degrades when the available transmission
power decreases, which is possible because UT SINR becomes
lower at this time. Moreover, according to Table III, when the
transmission power budget decreases from 26 dBw to 20 dBw,
DSTA outperforms ZF more signiﬁcantly, which corresponds
to the positioning accuracy improvement by 11.9% to 17.1%.
The reason for such a performance difference is that interference
power is not the key that inﬂuences UT SINR and UT positioning
accuracy if beam transmission power gets lower.
C. The Impact of the Number of Visible Satellites on the
Performance of DSTA-Based Beamforming
The CDFs of UT positioning accuracy when ITDOA = 3, 4, 5
(I = 16, 21, 26) are shown in Fig. 6, and it can be found that
a more signiﬁcant number of visible satellites can contribute
to a considerable improvement in positioning performance. As
shown in Table III, when the number of satellites serving the
UT increases from 3 to 5, the positioning accuracy with DSTA
improves by 29.8%. This phenomenon is expected because
more good-quality signals can be measured, and better network
topology geometry can be obtained. To verify the performance
gain of our proposal, we list the accuracy performance under
different beamforming schemes and ITDOA in Table III.

Scheduling
To examine the performance of the proposed beam scheduling
scheme, Fig. 7 shows the CDFs of UT positioning accuracy
under GDOP-based beam scheduling and our proposal with
m = 1, 4, 12 and it can be found that the proposed scheme
outperforms GDOP-based beam scheduling, which is more sig-
niﬁcant when the parameter m is appropriately selected. More-
over, as shown in Table IV, the proposed HBS scheme always
results in substantial gains in positioning performance with
different beamforming schemes. Speciﬁcally, it outperforms
GDOP-based beam scheduling by 28.3%, 55.9%, and 53.2% in

average positioning accuracy with DSTA-based beamforming
for m = 1, 4, 12, respectively. The above results are because the
GDOP-based scheme only considers the UT-satellite topology
geometry. In contrast, the HBS scheme considers the impact
of geometric topology property and channel correlation among
UTs on positioning performance.
At last, to further reveal the intrinsic inﬂuence of parameter m
in the proposed HBS scheme, Figs. 8 and 9 show the CDFs of UT
SINR and GDOP under different m. In Fig. 8, it is demonstrated
that smaller m contributes to higher UT SINR, and HBS-DSTA
achieves the best UT SINR performance with m = 1. However,
this does not necessarily result in the positioning performance.
As m becomes smaller, as shown in Fig. 9, the GDOP value
increases rapidly due to the formation of improper UT-satellite
topology. Although the communication-oriented scheme ex-
hibitsbetterSINRandGDOP-basedandparallax-basedschemes
exhibit better GDOP, HBS has superior positioning perfor-
mance. These results reﬂect there exists a trade-off between UT
SINR and GDOP value that can be adjusted by m.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, positioning-oriented beam scheduling and
beamforming have been studied in multi-beam LEO satellite
networks. As user positioning performance suffers from se-
vere inter-beam interference and improper UT-satellite topology
geometry, based on the monotonic relationship between user
positioning accuracy and perceived SINR, we have designed a
dynamic SINR adjustment based beamforming algorithm with
SDR technique and also a fast heuristic beam scheduling algo-
rithm that takes channel correlation among users and satellite-
user topology geometric property into account. By simulation,
it has been shown that average user positioning accuracy can
be improved by 17.1% and 55.9%, compared to conventional
beamforming and beam scheduling schemes, respectively.
