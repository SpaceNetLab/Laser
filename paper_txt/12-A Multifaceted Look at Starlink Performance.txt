ABSTRACT
In recent years, Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) mega-constellations have
ushered in a new era for ubiquitous Internet access. The Starlink net-
work from SpaceX stands out as the only commercial LEO network
with over 2M+ customers and more than 4000 operational satellites.
In this paper, we conduct a first-of-its-kind extensive multi-faceted
analysis of Starlink performance leveraging several measurement
sources. First, based on 19.2M crowdsourced M-Lab speed tests from
34 countries since 2021, we analyze Starlink global performance rel-
ative to terrestrial cellular networks. Second, we examine Starlink’s
ability to support real-time latency and bandwidth-critical appli-
cations by analyzing the performance of (i) Zoom conferencing,
and (ii) Luna cloud gaming, comparing it to 5G and fiber. Third, we
perform measurements from Starlink-enabled RIPE Atlas probes
to shed light on the last-mile access and other factors affecting
its performance. Finally, we conduct controlled experiments from
Starlink dishes in two countries and analyze the impact of globally
synchronized “15-second reconfiguration intervals” of the satellite
links that cause substantial latency and throughput variations. Our
unique analysis paints the most comprehensive picture of Starlink’s
global and last-mile performance to date.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past two decades, the Internet’s reach has grown rapidly,
driven by innovations and investments in wireless access [22, 46, 47]
(both cellular and WiFi) and fiber backhaul deployment that has
interconnected the globe [3, 8, 10, 24, 78]. Yet, the emergence of
Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networking, spearheaded by ven-
tures like Starlink [66], OneWeb [50], and Kuiper [4], is poised to
revolutionize global connectivity. LEO networks consist of mega-
constellations with thousands of satellites orbiting at 300–2000 km
altitudes, promising ubiquitous low latency coverage worldwide.
Consequently, these networks are morphing into “global ISPs” capa-
ble of challenging existing Internet monopolies [67], bridging con-
nectivity gaps in remote regions [36, 70], and providing support in
disaster-struck regions with impaired terrestrial infrastructure [21].
Starlink from SpaceX stands out with its expansive fleet of 4000
satellites catering to 2M+ subscribers across 63 countries [60, 77].
The LEO operator plans to further amplify its coverage and quality
of service (QoS) by launching ≈42,000 additional satellites in the
coming years [15]. However, despite significant global interest and
the potential to impact the existing Internet ecosystem, only limited
explorations have been made within the research community to
understand Starlink’s performance. The challenge stems from a
lack of global vantage points required to accurately gauge the net-
work’s performance since factors such as orbital coverage, density
of ground infrastructure, etc., can impact connectivity across re-
gions. Initial studies have resorted to measurements from a handful
of geographical locations [25, 35, 36, 40] or extrapolated global per-
formance through simulations [26] and emulations [31]. However,
the community agrees on the limited scope of such studies and has
made open calls to establish a global LEO measurement testbed to
address this challenge [52, 61, 74]. Some researchers have navigated
around this hurdle by exploring alternative measurement methods,
e.g., by targeting exposed services behind user terminals [19], by
mining measurements on social media platforms [73], or by recruit-
ing users in select regions [58]. While innovative, we argue that
these techniques are insufficient to uncover the intricacies affecting
the network, specifically its capability to support applications.
This paper addresses this knowledge gap and provides the first
comprehensive multi-faceted measurement study on Starlink. Our
work is distinct from previous research in several ways. Firstly,

we examine the global evolution of the network since 2021 by
analyzing the M-Lab speed test measurements [12] from 34 coun-
tries (largest so far). We complement our investigation through
active measurements over 98 RIPE Atlas [59] probes in 21 countries
and conduct high-resolution experiments over controlled terminals
in two European countries to investigate real-time web applica-
tion performance and factors impacting Starlink’s last-mile access.
Specifically, we make the following contributions in this work.
(1) We present a longitudinal study of global Starlink latency and
throughput performance from M-Lab users in §4. Our analysis, in-
corporating ≈19.2 M samples, reveals that Starlink performs com-
petitively to terrestrial cellular networks. However, its performance
varies globally due to infrastructure deployment differences, and
is dependent on the density and closeness of ground stations and
Points-of-Presence (PoPs). We also observe signs of bufferbloating
as Starlink’s latency significantly increases under traffic load.
(2) We assess and compare the performance of real-time web appli-
cations, specifically Zoom video conferencing and Amazon Luna
cloud gaming, to terrestrial networks (§5). We find that, under opti-
mal conditions, Starlink is capable of supporting such applications,
matching the performance over cellular; however, we do observe
some artifacts due to the network’s periodic reconfigurations.
(3) We perform targeted measurements from Starlink RIPE At-
las [59] probes and leverage their diverse locations to characterize
the satellite last-mile performance (§6.1). We find that the “bent-
pipe” (terminal ↔satellte ↔ground station) latency within the
dense 53° shell remains consistent worldwide (≈40 ms), and is sig-
nificantly lower to yet incomplete 70° and 97.6° orbits. We also find
evidence of Starlink inter-satellite links (ISLs) delivering superior
performance to terrestrial paths for connecting remote regions.
(4) Our fine-grained measurements from terminals in two European
countries confirm that Starlink performs network reconfigurations
every 15 s, leading to noticeable latency and throughput degra-
dations at sub-second granularity. By correlating data from our
terminals in Germany (within 53°) and Scotland (restricted to 70°
and 97.6° coverage), we find that the reconfigurations are globally
synchronized and likely independent of satellite handovers.
Leveraging multi-dimensional, global, and controlled high reso-
lution measurements, our findings distinctively advance the state-
of-the-art by illuminating Starlink’s performance and the influence
of internal network operations on real-time applications. To foster
reproducibility and enable future research, we publish our > 300 GB
collected dataset and associated scripts at [44] and [45].

BACKGROUND
Starlink is a LEO satellite network operated by SpaceX that aims to
provide global Internet coverage through a fleet of satellites flying
at ≈500 km above the Earth’s surface. The majority of Starlink’s
operational 4000 satellites lie within the 53° shell, which only covers
parts of the globe (see Figure 1). The 70° and 97.6° orbits allow
serving regions near the poles. These other shells however have
fewer satellites (see Appendix A, Table 2 for constellation details).
Figure 2 shows the cross-section of Starlink end-to-end connec-
tivity. To access the Internet over the Starlink network, end-users
require a dish, a.k.a. “Dishy”1, that communicates with satellites
visible above 25° of elevation through phased-array antennas using
Ku-band (shown as User Link (UL)). Starlink satellites, equipped
with multiple antennas subdivided into beams, can connect to mul-
tiple terminals simultaneously [18] and relay all connections to a
ground station (GS) on a Ka-band link (shown in green). The connec-
tion forms a direct “bent-pipe” in case the terminal and GS lie within
a single satellite’s coverage cone; otherwise, the satellites can relay
within space to reach far-off GSs via laser inter-satellite links (ISLs),
forming an “extended bent-pipe”. Note that not all Starlink satellites
are ISL-capable and it is difficult to effectively estimate ISL usage
as Starlink satellites have no visibility at IP layer [52]. Finally, the
GSs terrestrially relay traffic to Starlink points-of-presence (PoPs),
which route it to the destination server via terrestrial Internet [6].
No official source exists, so we rely on crowdsourced data for the
geolocations of GSs and PoPs [51], which is also shown in Figure 1.

MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY
3.1
Global Measurements
Measurement Lab (M-Lab) M-Lab [12] is an open-source project
that allows users to perform end-to-end throughput and latency
speed tests from their devices to 500+ servers in 60+ metropoli-
tan areas [30]. Google offers M-Lab measurements when a user
searches for "speed test" [29], serving as the primary source of
measurement initiations [12, 20, 54]. At its core, M-Lab uses the
Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) [39], which measures uplink and
downlink performance using a single 10 s WebSocket TCP connec-
tion. The platform also records fine-grained transport-level metrics
(tcp_info), including goodput, round-trip time (RTT) and losses,
along with IP, Autonomous System Number (ASN), and geoloca-
tion of both the end-user device and the selected M-Lab server.
1We use “Dishy” and “user terminal” interchangeably in the paper.

M-lab measurements
Figure 3: Overview of global Starlink measurements in this
study. Heatmap denotes M-Lab speedtest measurement den-
sities. Starlink RIPE Atlas probes are shown as red circles.
We identify measurements from the Starlink clients via their ASN
(AS14593). The M-Lab dataset includes samples from 59 out of 63
countries where Starlink is operational. We restrict our analysis
to ndt7 measurements, which use TCP BBR and countries with at
least 1000 measurements since June 2021 (launch of Starlink v1.0
satellites [28]), resulting in 19.2 M M-Lab measurement samples
from 34 countries. M-Lab infers the approximate location of Star-
link users from their public IP which is assigned by the PoP [69]. As
a result, all speed tests across countries are mapped to a city, except
for USA and Canada, which are sub-divided into multiple regions.
While we examine such artifacts by contrasting the M-Lab and
RIPE Atlas results (§6.1), we approached our analysis with caution,
particularly when examining fine-grained region-specific insights.
RIPE Atlas. RIPE Atlas is a measurement platform that the net-
working research community commonly employs for conducting
measurements [59]. We utilized 98 Starlink RIPE Atlas probes across
21 countries (see Figure 3). Our measurement targets were 145
data centers from seven major cloud providers – Amazon EC2,
Google, Microsoft, Digital Ocean, Alibaba, Amazon Lightsail, and
Oracle (see Appendix B). The chosen operators represent the global
cloud market [3, 24, 32, 78] and ensure that our endpoints are
close to Starlink PoPs, which are usually co-located with Inter-
net eXchange Point (IXP) or data center facilities [19, 25]. We
perform ICMP traceroutes from Atlas probes to endpoints sit-
uated on the same or neighboring continent. We extract and track
per-hop latencies between Starlink probe terminal-to-GS (identi-
fied by static 100.64.0.1 address), GS-to-PoP (172.16/12) and
PoP-to-endpoint at 2 s intervals [52]. Additionally, we also ex-
tract semantic location embeddings in reverse DNS PTR entry,
e.g. tata-level3-seattle2.level3.net to further improve ge-
olocation accuracy [34]. Our experiments over ten months (Dec
2022 to Sept 2023) resulted in ≈1.8 M measurement samples.
3.2
Real-time Web Application Measurements
Zoom Video Conferencing. We set up a Zoom call between our
server, with access to an unobstructed Starlink dish and 1 Gbps
Ethernet, and an AWS machine located close to the assigned Starlink
PoP. We set up virtual cameras and microphones on both machines,
which were fed by a pre-recorded video of a person talking, resulting
in bidirectional transmission. Both servers were synchronized to
local stratum-1 NTP servers and we recorded (and analyzed) sub-
second Zoom QoS metrics using the toolchain from [41].
Cloud Gaming. We leverage the automated system from [17] to
evaluate the performance of playing the racing game “The Crew”
on the Amazon Luna [2] platform. The system uses (i) a custom
streaming client to record end-to-end information about media

streams, such as frame and bitrate, and (ii) a bot that executes in-
game actions at pre-defined intervals. We compute the game delay
as the time passed since the input action was triggered in post-
processing. Amazon Luna serves games at 60 FPS and 1920×1080
resolution which adaptively reduces to 1280×720 depending on the
network. We ran the game streaming client on the same machine
as the Zoom measurements, additionally setting up a 5G modem to
compare Starlink against cellular. Similar to Zoom, the Luna game
server was on AWS server close to our Starlink PoP (≈1 ms RTT).
3.3
Targeted Measurements
A significant limitation of RIPE Atlas measurements is their lack of
sub-second visibility, which is essential for understanding the intri-
cacies of Starlink network. To combat this, we orchestrated a set of
precise, tailored, and controlled experiments, utilizing two Starlink
terminals as vantage points (VPs) situated in Germany and Scot-
land. Our dish in Germany connects to the 53° shell while Scotland
dish, due to the high latitude location, can be shielded to confine
its communication to the 70° and 97.6° orbits. We do this by placing
a metal sheeting as Faraday shield barrier at the South-facing angle
of the terminal, which obstructs its view from the 53° inclinations
(see Figure 4). We verify with external satellite trackers [27, 57]
that the terminal only received connectivity from satellites in 97°
or 70° inclinations, which resulted in brief connectivity windows
followed by periods of no service. We performed experiments using
the Isochronous Round-Trip Tester (irtt) [55] and iperf [16] tools.
The irtt setup records RTTs at high resolutions (3 ms interval) by
transmitting small UDP packets. The irtt servers were deployed
on cloud VMs in close proximity to the assigned Starlink PoP of
both VPs (within 1 ms) – minimizing the influence of terrestrial path
on our measurements. We used iperf to measure both uplink and
downlink throughput and record performance at 100 ms granularity.
Simultaneously, we polled the gRPC service on each terminal [65]
every second to obtain the connection status information.

GLOBAL STARLINK PERFORMANCE
We use the minimum RTT (minRTT) reported during ndt7 tests to
the closest M-Lab server globally as baseline since it is not affected
by queuing delays due to bandwidth-capped data transfers during
speed tests. For context, we also select measurements from devices
connected to the top-3 mobile network operators (MNOs) in each
country [43]. Note that our filteration results in a mix of wired and
wireless access networks since M-Lab does not provide a way to
distinguish between the two. We use the same endpoints for both
Starlink and terrestrial networks (see §3.1).

select cities in Europe and South America, respectively.
Global View. Figure 5 shows that, for a majority of countries, clients
using terrestrial ISPs achieve better latencies over Starlink. While
the median latency of Starlink hovers around 40–50 ms, this distri-
bution varies significantly across geographical regions. For instance,
in Colombia, Starlink reports better latencies than established terres-
trial networks. Conversely, in Manila (The Philippines), Starlink’s
performance is notably inferior (Figure 6). The uneven distribution
of GSs and PoPs (Figure 1) may explain the latency differences; the
USA, which experiences significantly lower latencies, also boasts a
robust ground infrastructure. We observe similar trends in Kenya
and Mozambique where the closest PoP is located in Nigeria.
Well-Provisioned Regions. Even though a significant portion of
global Starlink measurement samples originate from Seattle (≈10%),
the region shows consistently low latencies, with the 75th percentile
well below 50 ms (Figure 6). Contributing factors can be dense GS
availability or service prioritization for Starlink’s headquarters. We
also observe that Starlink performance is fairly consistent across
the USA, confirming that Seattle is not an anomaly but the norm
(see Figure 22a in Appendix C). This highlights the LEO network’s
potential to bridge Internet access disparities, which currently af-
fects the quality of terrestrial Internet in the USA [37, 53]. Europe is
also relatively well covered with GSs but hosts only three PoPs that
are in the UK, Germany, and Spain. Proximity to the nearest PoP
correlates strongly with minRTT performance in Figure 7 – Dublin,
London, and Berlin exhibit comparable latencies to the US, while
for Rome and Paris, the 75th percentile is ≈20 ms longer. Unlike US,
Starlink latencies in EU has longer tail, often surpassing 100 ms.
Under-Provisioned Regions. Starlink’s performance in Colombia
hints at its potential for connecting under-provisioned regions.
However, Figure 7 shows that Starlink in South America (SA) trails
significantly behind the US and Europe, with the 75th percentile
exceeding 100 ms and tail reaching 200 ms. Oceania also shows
similar performance (see Figure 22b in Appendix C). By extracting
the share of satellite vs. terrestrial path (i.e PoP ↔M-Lab servers,
see Figure 18 in Appendix C)2, we find that the majority of SA
Starlink latency is due to the bent-pipe. In contrast, latencies from
Mexico and Africa (except Nigeria) show terrestrial influence, which
we allude to non-optimal PoP assignments by Starlink routing.
2We subtract the latency to the Starlink PoP reported by M-Lab’s reverse
traceroutes from the end-to-end TCP minRTT.

We also observe an interesting impact of ground infrastructure in
the Philippines, where a local PoP was deployed in May 2023. Prior
to this, Starlink traffic from the country was directed to the nearest
Japanese PoP, traversing long submarine links to circle back to the
geographically closest M-Lab server in Philippines – evident from
additional 50–70 ms RTT in Figure 19 in Appendix C for Philippines
users to reach in-country vs. Japanese M-Lab servers. However,
post-May 2023, the latencies to in-country servers reduced by 90%
as the traffic was routed via the local PoP. Despite such artifacts,
Starlink shows an evident trend towards more consistent sub-50 ms
latencies globally over the past 17 months, specifically evident in
Sydney (Figure 21a in Appendix C). We conclude that while Starlink
slightly lags behind terrestrial networks today, the gap will continue
to shrink as the ground (and satellite) infrastructure expands.
Latency Under Load. Recent findings suggest that Starlink may
be susceptible to bufferbloat [13, 23, 48], wherein latencies dur-
ing traffic load can increase significantly due to excessive queue
buildups [40]. To explore this globally, we evaluate the RTT infla-
tion, i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum RTT
observed during a speed test. Figure 8 reveals significant delay in-
flation under load as during active downloads, Starlink experiences
≈2–4× increased RTTs, reaching almost 400–500 ms (Figure 8a).
While such inflations are consistent across all Starlink service areas,
they are more prominent in regions with subpar baseline perfor-
mance, e.g., Mexico. Note that the Starlink latency under load is not
symmetric. The 60th percentile of RTT during uploads increases to
≤100 ms globally (see Figure 8(b)) compared to ≈200 ms during
downloads. We observe similar behavior while conducting iperf
over our controlled terminals. Possible explanations can be queue
size differences at the Dishy (affecting uploads), the ground sta-
tion (affecting downloads), or satellites (impacting both). It is also
plausible that Starlink employs active queue management (AQM)
techniques [1] to moderate uplink latencies under congestion. This
approach, however, may adversely impact applications that demand
both high bandwidth and low latency – which we explore in §5.
Goodput. Figure 9 shows Starlink download and upload goodputs
from speed tests globally. Unlike latencies (Figure 6), the goodput
distributions appear relatively homogeneous. Most Starlink clients

achieve ≈50–100 Mbps download and ≈4–12 Mbps upload rates
at the 75th percentile. We also do not find any correlation between
baseline latencies (see Figure 6) and upload/download goodput,
evident from the contrasting cases of Dublin and Manila. However,
we observe an inverse correlation between loss rates and good-
puts; increasing from 4–8% at the 75th-percentile (see Figure 22 in
Appendix C). Seattle, notable for its latency performance, records
average goodputs. Considering high measurement density from
this region, the trend might be due to Starlink’s internal throttling
or load-balancing to prevent congestion [68]. We also find that
over the past 17 months, Starlink goodputs have stabilized rather
than increased, with almost all geographical regions demonstrating
similar performance (shown in Figure 21 in Appendix C).
Takeaway #1 — Starlink exhibits competitive performance to ter-
restrial ISPs on a global scale, especially in regions with dense GS
and PoP deployment. However, noticeable degradation is observ-
able in regions with limited ground infrastructure. Our results
further confirm that Starlink is affected by bufferbloat. Starlink
appears to be optimizing for consistent global performance, albeit
with a slight reduction in goodput.

REAL-TIME APPLICATION PERFORMANCE
While the global Starlink performance in §4 is promising for sup-
porting web-based applications, it does not accurately capture the
potential impact of minute network changes caused by routing,
satellite switches, bufferbloating, etc., on application performance.
Real-time web applications are known to be sensitive to such fluc-
tuations [7, 17, 40]. In this section, we examine the performance of
Zoom and Amazon Luna cloud gaming over Starlink (see §3.2 for
measurements details). This allows us to assess the suitability of the
LEO network to meet the requirements of the majority of real-time
Internet-based applications, as both applications impose a strict
latency control loop. Cloud gaming necessitates high downlink
bandwidth, while Zoom utilizes uplink and downlink capacity.
Zoom Video Conferencing. Figure 10 shows samples from Zoom
calls conducted over a high-speed terrestrial network and over Star-
link. The total uplink throughput over Starlink is slightly higher,

which we trace to FEC (Forward Error Correction) packets that are
frequently sent in addition to raw video data (on average 146±99 Kbps
vs. 2±2 Kbps over terrestrial). The frame rate, inferred from the
packets received by the Zoom peer, does not meaningfully differ
between the two networks (≈27 FPS). Note that, since Zoom does
not saturate the available uplink and downlink capacity, it should
not be impacted by bufferbloating. Yet, we observe a slightly higher
loss rate over LEO, which the application combats by proactively
utilizing FEC. The uplink one-way delay (OWD) over Starlink is
higher and more variable compared to the terrestrial connection
(on average 52±14 ms vs. 27±7 ms). All observations also apply to
the downlink except that Starlink’s downlink latency (35±11 ms) is
similar to the terrestrial connection (32±7 ms). Our analysis broadly
agrees with [79] but our packet-level insight reveals bitrate fluctua-
tions partly caused by FEC. Further, our Starlink connection was
more reliable and we did not experience second-long outages.
Interestingly, we observe that the Starlink OWD often notice-
ably shifts at interval points that occur at 15 s increments. Further
investigation reveals the cause to be the Starlink reconfiguration
interval, which, as reported in FCC filings [72], is the time-step at
which the satellite paths are reallocated to the users. Other recent
work also reports periodic link degradations at 15 s boundaries in
their experiments, with RTT spikes and packet losses of several or-
ders [25, 52, 74]. We explore the impact of reconfiguration intervals
and other Starlink-internal actions on network performance in §6.

fluctuations, frame drops and freezes3. Starlink exhibits the highest
game delay, i.e., the delay experienced by the player between issuing
a command and witnessing its effect. Specifically, the wired network
delivers the visual response about 2 frames (≈33 ms) earlier than
both 5G and Starlink. While examining the gaming performance
over time, we observe occasional drops to < 20 FPS over Starlink (see
Figure 11), that coincide with Starlink’s reconfiguration interval.
These fluctuations are only visible at sub-second granularity and,
hence, are not reflected in global performance analysis (§4).
Despite these variations, Starlink’s performance remains com-
petitive with 5G, highlighting its potential to deliver real-time ap-
plication support, especially in regions with less mature cellular
infrastructure. Note, however, that our Starlink terminal was set up
without obstructions and the weather conditions during measure-
ments were favorable to its operation [36]. Different conditions,
especially mobility, may change the relative performance of Starlink
and cellular, which we plan to explore further in the near future.
Takeaway #2 — Starlink’s performance is competitive with the
current 5G deployment for supporting demanding real-time ap-
plications. We also observe that Starlink experiences regular per-
formance fluctuations every 15s linked to its reconfiguration
intervals. While these internal black-box parameters do influence
performance to a certain extent, application-specific corrective
measures, like FEC, are effective in mitigating these artifacts.

DISSECTING THE BENT-PIPE
We now attempt to uncover Starlink’s behind-the-scenes opera-
tions and their impact on network performance. We follow a two-
pronged approach to undertake this challenge. Our longitudinal
traceroute measurements over RIPE Atlas accurately isolate the
bent-pipe (terminal-to-PoP) global performance, allowing us to cor-
relate it with parameters like ground station deployment, satellite
availability, etc. (§6.1). We then perform controlled, high-resolution
experiments over Starlink terminals deployed in two EU countries
to zoom in on bent-pipe operation and highlight traffic engineering
signatures that may impact application performance (§6.2).
6.1
Global Bent-Pipe Performance
Starlink vs. Cellular Last-mile We contrast our end-to-end M-
Lab and real-time application analysis by comparing the Starlink
bent-pipe latencies from RIPE Atlas traceroutes to cellular wire-
less last-mile (device-to-ISP network) access. Given the under-
representation of cellular probes in RIPE Atlas, we augment our
dataset with recent measurements from Dang et al. [10], which
3Freeze is when the inter-frame delay (IFD) is larger than max(3×IFD, IFD+150).
Distance from Dishy to GS [kms]

leveraged 115,000 cellular devices worldwide over the Speedchecker
platform. Figure 12 presents a comparative analysis of Starlink and
cellular last-mile across countries common in both datasets. Consis-
tent with our previous findings, we find that the Starlink bent-pipe
latencies fall within 36–48 ms, with the median hovering around
40 ms for almost all countries. Similarly, we find consistent cellular
last-mile latencies across all countries, but almost 1.5× less than
Starlink. Recent investigations [42] report similar access latencies
over WiFi and cellular networks. The bent-pipe latencies also cor-
roborate our estimations in §4 that the terminal ↔PoP path is the
dominant contributor to the end-to-end latency. Out of the 21 coun-
tries with Starlink-enabled RIPE Atlas probes, the only exceptions
where the bent-pipe latency is significantly higher (≈100 ms) are
the Virgin Islands (US), Reunion Islands (FR), and Falkland Islands
(UK). Correlating with Figure 3, we find that Starlink neither has a
GS nor a PoP in these regions, which may result in traffic routing
over ISLs to far-off GS leading to longer bent-pipe latencies.
Impact of Ground Infrastructure. We extend our analysis by
exploring the correlation between the distance from Starlink users
to the GS and bent-pipe latencies. Recall that we rely on crowd-
sourced data [51] for geolocating Starlink ground infrastructure
since these are not officially publicly disclosed. We deduce through
our traceroutes that Starlink directs its subscribers to the nearest
GS relative to the PoP, as the GS ↔PoP latencies are ≈5 ms (al-
most) globally (see Figure 20 in Appendix C – sole exceptions being
US and Canada with 7–8 ms, likely due to abundant availability of
GSs and PoPs causing routing complexities). Figure 13 correlates
the reported bent-pipe latency with the terminal ↔GS distance.
Each point in the plot denotes at least 1000 measurements. We
observe that bent-pipe latencies tend to increase with increasing
distance to the GS. Furthermore, we find that the predominant
distance between GS and the user terminal is ≤1200 km, which is
also the approximate coverage area width of a single satellite from
500 km altitude [5] – suggesting that these connections are likely
using direct bent-pipe, either without or with short ISL paths. Few
terminals, specifically in Reunion, Falkland and the Virgin Islands,
connect to GSs significantly farther away, possible only via long
ISL chains, which we analyze further as a case study.
Case Study: Reunion Island. The majority of Starlink satellites
(starting from v1.5 deployed in 2021) are equipped with ISLs [75],
and reports from SpaceX suggest active utilization of these links [76].
Recent studies also agree with the use of ISLs [19], but point out
inefficiencies in space routing [33, 74]. Nonetheless, the invisibility
of satellite hops in traceroutes poses a challenge in accurately
assessing the use or impact of ISLs. As such, we focus on a probe in
Reunion Island (RU), which connects to the Internet via Frankfurt

PoP (≈9000 km). Figure 14 segments the bent-pipe RTT between
the user terminal (Dishy) to GS (non-terrestrial), and from GS to
the PoP (terrestrial). For comparison, we also plot the RTTs from a
probe within Germany (DE) connecting to the same PoP (≈500 km,
in red). The vertical lines represent the median RTT over terrestrial
infrastructure from both probe locations to the PoP. Firstly, we ob-
serve minimal GS ↔PoP latency for both locations, verifying that
the RU satellite link is using ISLs. Secondly, in RU, Starlink shows
significant latency improvement over fiber (≈60 ms). This is be-
cause the island has limited connectivity with two submarine cables
routing traffic 10,000 km away, either in Asia or South America [49].
Starlink provides a better option by avoiding the terrestrial route
altogether, directly connecting RU users to the dense backbone
infrastructure in EU [8]. However, since the bent-pipe incurs at
least 30–40 ms latency in the best-case, Starlink is less attractive in
regions with robust terrestrial network infrastructure (also evident
from the DE probe where fiber achieves better latencies).
Impact of Serving Orbit. Recall that the majority of Starlink satel-
lites are deployed in the 53° inclination (see Table 2 in Appendix A).
Consequently, network performance for clients located outside
this orbit’s range may vary widely as they are serviced by fewer
satellites in 70° and 97.6° orbits. Figure 15 contrasts the bent-pipe
latencies of probe in Alaska (61.5685N, 149.0125W) [“A”] to probes
within 53° orbit. Despite dense GS availability, the bent-pipe laten-
cies for Alaska are significantly higher (≈2×). The Swedish probe
[“B”] at 59.6395N is at the boundary of 53° orbit but still exhibits
comparable latency to Canada, UK, and Germany. Furthermore,
the Alaskan probe experiences intermittent connectivity, attributed
to the infrequent passing of satellite clusters within the 70° and
97.6° orbits. These findings indicate substantial discrepancies in
Starlink’s performance across geographical regions, which may
evolve for the better as more satellites are launched in these orbits.
Nevertheless, we leverage the sparse availability of satellites at
higher latitudes to further dissect the bent-pipe operations in §6.2.
Takeaway #3 — The Starlink “bent-pipe” accounts for ≈40 ms
latency globally. In certain cases with ISLs use, the latencies might
escalate, yet still outshine traditional terrestrial networks when
bridging remote regions. The satellite link yields stable latencies,
provided that the client is served by the dense 53° orbit.
6.2
Controlled Experiments
Global Scheduling. We performed simultaneous iRTT measure-
ments from terminals in Edinburgh (UK) and Munich (DE). Note
that the countries are sufficiently geographically removed that
Figure 15: Bent-pipe latencies for “A” (in Alaska) covered by
the 70° and 97.6° while the rest (Sweden “B”, Canada “C”, UK
“D”, and Germany “E”) are also covered by 53°.
both cannot be connected to the same serving satellite and are
assigned different PoPs. The resulting RTTs, shown in Figure 16a,
vary consistently, being comparatively stable within each Starlink
reconfiguration interval but potentially changing between intervals.
Moreover, the time-wise alignment of reconfiguration intervals for
both vantage points indicates that Starlink operates on a globally
coordinated schedule, rather than on a per-Dishy or per-satellite
basis. These results are in line with other recent studies [74], which
also hint that Starlink utilizes a global network controller. Previous
studies [11] have noticed drops in downlink throughput every 15 s
but have not correlated these with the reconfiguration intervals. We
also observe throughput drops on both downlink and uplink, shown
in Figure 16b, that occur at the reconfiguration interval boundaries.
Similar to the RTT, the throughput typically remains relatively con-
sistent within an interval, but fluctuates between intervals. These
results corroborate the periodic degradations observed in §5.
Disproving Satellite Handoff Hypothesis. Previous works have
suggested satellite or beam changes at reconfiguration interval
boundaries to be the root-cause of network degradation [11, 64, 74].
To investigate this hypothesis, we deliberately obstructed the field-
of-view of our UK terminal to prevent it from connecting to the
dense 53° shell (see §3.3 for details). The restriction curtailed the
number of candidate (potentially connectable) satellites to 13%, re-
sulting in intermittent connectivity. By synchronizing the timings of
each connectivity window with the overhead positions of candidate
satellites (from CelesTrak [27] and other sources [57]), we identify
several windows where the terminal can be served by only a single
satellite. Figure 16c (upper) shows RTTs from such a window. The
significant RTT variance between intervals invalidates the hypoth-
esis that the RTT changes are caused by satellite handovers (no
handoffs are possible with single satellite in field-of-view). Similar
to RTT, we also witness uplink and downlink throughput drops at
interval boundaries even when single candidate satellite is visible.
Scheduling Updates. Figure 16c (lower) shows the distribution
of start and end times of the connectivity windows during our
restricted field-of-view experiments. We observed a strong correla-
tion between connectivity end times and reconfiguration interval
(RI) boundary, which is not seen with start times4. The result hints
at internal network scheduling changes at reconfiguration interval
boundaries, i.e., Starlink assigns its terminals new satellites (or fre-
quencies) every 15s. We hypothesize that with an obstructed view,
the scheduler cannot find better alternatives in the 70° and 97.6°
orbits, resulting in connectivity loss at the end of the window.
4The fact that many appear to end 1s after the boundary is an artifact of the limited
(per-second) granularity of the gRPC data and that the gRPC timestamps originate
from the client making the gRPC requests rather than the user terminal.

Analysis Summary. Putting together our various observations, we
theorize that Starlink relies on a global scheduler that re-allocates
the user ↔satellite(s) ↔GS path every 15s. An FCC filing from Star-
link implies this behavior [64] and recent studies also suggest that
the LEO operator performs periodic load balancing at reconfigura-
tion boundaries, reconnecting all active clients to satellites [19, 74].
The theory also explains our observed RTT and throughput changes
when only a single candidate satellite is in view. It is plausible that
Starlink may have rescheduled the terminal to the same satellite but
with reallocated frequency and routing resources. Regardless, these
reconfigurations result in brief sub-second connection disruptions,
which may become more noticeable at the application-layer as the
number of subscribers on the network increases over time.
Takeaway #4 — Starlink uses 15s-long reconfiguration intervals to
globally schedule and manage the network. Such intervals cause
latency/throughput variations at the interval boundaries. Hand-
offs between satellites are not the cause of these effects. Indeed,
our findings hint at a scheduling system reallocating resources
for connections once every reconfiguration interval.

RELATED WORK
LEO satellites have become a subject of extensive research in re-
cent years, with a particular focus on advancing the performance
of various systems and technologies. Starlink, the posterchild of
LEO networks, continues to grow in its maturity and reach with
> 2M subscribers as of September 2023 [60]. Despite its growing
popularity, there has been limited exploration into measuring Star-
link’s performance so far. Existing studies either have a narrow
scope, employing only a few vantage points [11, 35, 40] or focus
on broad application-level operation [25, 79] without investigating
root-causes. Few studies have looked into the mobile behavior of
Starlink and compared it to terrestrial cellular carriers [14, 36].
A few endeavors have attempted to unveil the operations of
Starlink’s black-box network. Pan et al. [52] revealed the operator’s
internal network topology from traceroutes, whereas Tanveer
et al. [74] spotlighted a potential global network controller. The ab-
sence of global measurement sites poses a predominant challenge
hampering a comprehensive understanding of Starlink’s perfor-
mance. As we show in this work, Starlink’s performance varies
geographically due to differing internal configurations and ground
infrastructure availability. Some researchers have devised innova-
tive methods to combat this. For example, Izhikevich et al. [19]
conducted measurements towards exposed services behind the
Starlink user terminal, while Taneja et al. [73] mined social media
platforms like Reddit to gauge the LEO network’s performance. Our
study not only corroborates and extends existing findings but also
stands as the most extensive examination to date. Our approach
– anchored in detailed insights from 34 countries, leveraging 19.2
million crowdsourced M-Lab measurements, 1.8 million active RIPE
Atlas measurements, and two controlled terminals connecting to
different Starlink orbits – provides a deeper understanding of the
Starlink “bent-pipe” and overall performance.

CONCLUSIONS
Despite its potential as a “global ISP” capable of challenging the
state of global Internet connectivity, there have been limited per-
formance evaluations of Starlink to date. We conducted a multi-
faceted investigation of Starlink, providing insights from a global
perspective down to internal network operations. Globally, our anal-
ysis showed that Starlink is comparable to cellular for supporting
real-time applications (in our case Zoom and Luna cloud gaming),
though this varies based on proximity to ground infrastructure. Our
case study shows Starlink inter-satellite connections helping re-
mote users achieve better Internet service than terrestrial networks.
However, at sub-second granularity, Starlink exhibits performance
variations, likely due to periodic internal network reconfigurations
at 15s intervals. We find that the reconfigurations are synchronized
globally and are not caused by satellite handovers. As such, this
first-of-its-kind study is a step towards a clearer understanding of
Starlink’s operations and performance as it continues to evolve.

STARLINK ORBITAL INFORMATION
Starlink and other emerging LEO satellite constellations, such as
OneWeb and Kuiper [4, 50], are termed megaconstellations since
they combine multiple orbital shells compared to single shell sys-
tems like Iridium [56]. Table 2 details the number of satellites and
their altitude in Starlink’s orbital shells. While discussing Starlink’s
constellation design, we simplify the orbit into circular orbits.

influenced by previous studies that have found that significant
end-to-end performance differences may appear while measuring
different cloud networks due to private WANs, peering agreements,
etc. [9, 10]. We believe that our comprehensive endpoint selection
reduces potential biases due to Internet traffic steering.

GLOBAL STARLINK PERFORMANCE
Figure 21 provides an overview of Starlink’s performance over one
year from selected cities in each continent. We observe decreasing
goodputs over time, which can be largely attributed to an increase
of Starlink users. The RTT values, while relatively stable, are higher
for countries outside of major Starlunk operational areas. Sydney
(AU) is a notable exception where RTT decreases over time. Fig-
ure 19 shows the median minRTT from Philippines to in-country

ure 22 shows loss rates during M-Lab download measurements (see
§4). Figure 23 complements Figure 7 and shows the distribution of
the minimum RTT (minRTT) during M-Lab measurements from
selected cities in North America and Oceania. Starlink’s perfor-
mance in North America varies slightly across different cities and
all achieve lower latencies compared to rest of the globe. In Ocea-
nia, tests from Auckland and Perth exhibit a similarly low minRTT
due to PoPs and GSs near both cities. Latencies in Sydney’s has
improved recently (2023/06) as shown in Figure 21a.
D
GLOBAL VIEW OF BENT-PIPE OPERATION
Figure 20 augments our discussion on Starlink last-mile perfor-
mance in §6.1 and shows GS ↔PoP latencies globally. It is apparent
that the latencies are similar all over the world (≤6 ms) except in
North America (≥6 ms), likely due to dense deployment of GSs
and PoPs in these regions (see Figure 1).
E
TARGETED MEASUREMENT CHALLENGES
We encountered several challenges during our controlled measure-
ments over shielded terminal in §6.2 which we elucidate for re-
searchers who plan to replicate our setup. Specifically, both irtt
and iperf could not handle interruptions well as they rely on single
TCP connection which eventually times out. To overcome this, we
replaced irtt with periodic ICMP ping packets sent every 200 ms.
On the other hand, we manually controlled iperf to overcome con-
nection drops. Specifically, we started iperf every time we detected
the start of connectivity window (from pings) and stopped the ex-
periment upon interruption. Before starting iperf at next window
detection, we also restarted the server. Automatically restarting

the iperf server at the end of each connectivity window was not
possible because the Starlink-connected computer, now without an
Internet connection, could not signal to the remote iperf server.
An additional challenge caused by the interrupted nature of the
connection became apparent in the analysis phase. The unstable
connection prevented the clock on the machine connected to the
Dishy from synchronising over NTP, resulting in it drifting by
several seconds duration of the experiment setup. Accordingly,
when the absolute timestamps of the recorded data were analysed,
they were adjusted to account for the time slip. The gRPC data was
collected from another machine that did not suffer from clock drift.
