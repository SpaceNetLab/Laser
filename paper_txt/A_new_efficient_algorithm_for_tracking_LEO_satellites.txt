satellites can be grouped into two different categories: “signalbased" and "program-based" methods. In this paper, we employ

accurate and reliable.

Along with satellite technology development, researchers offered various ways for tracking LEO satellites, but many of the presented ways are either expensive or inaccurate. Therefore, there is a need to present accurate and inexpensive ways for tracking satellites. The purpose of this paper is to present a new reliable algorithm for tracking LEO satellites, which employs an available TLE file as the primary data and predicts satellites’ orbital elements. In order to uniquely identify a satellite orbit, we need its orbital elements, including a set of six parameters. These six parameters are : 1. Eccentricity (e): This parameter determines how a satellite’s orbit deviates from a perfectly circular orbit. Indeed, it determines the shape of orbit. 2. Semi-major axis (a): This parameter defines the size of orbit and equals to the sum of apogee and perigee, divided by two. 3. Inclination (i): Inclination determines the vertical tilt of the orbit measured at the ascending node, with respect to the earth’s equatorial plane. 4. Right ascension of ascending node ( Ω ): This parameter horizontally orients the ascending node of the orbit, where it passes upward (with respect to the earth’s equatorial plane). These two elements (inclination and right ascension of ascending node) are used to determine the orientation of the orbital plane of a satellite. 5. Argument of perigee ( w ): This parameter is an angle measured from the ascending node to perigee, and determines the orientation of the orbit. 6. True anomaly (θ ): This parameter is an angle measured from the perigee to the position of the satellite at any given time. True anomaly determines the real geometric angle of the satellite. These six orbital elements are shown in Fig. 1. The NORAD website  provides some text files that include orbital elements for various satellites. These text files are called Two-Line Elements (TLE) files. Although there are a few algorithms, such as SGP, SGP4, SDP4, SGP8, and SDP8, that use TLE files to track satellites , this paper presents a new reliable algorithm for tracking LEO satellites, using TLE file. II. PROPOSED ALGORITHM In the suggested algorithm in this paper, an available TLE file is used for extracting the initial values of orbital elements (semi-major axis, inclination, eccentricity, argument of perigee, Right Ascension of Ascending Node (RAAN), and True Anomaly (TA)). Using these initial values, the initial velocity vector and position vector, are obtained. These initial vectors are for the time that the TLE file has been generated. Using the initial velocity and position vectors, and Lagrange coefficients, the velocity and position vectors for any desired time are estimated. Finally, these new vectors are used to calculate the orbital elements and to estimate the satellite’s location. This algorithm includes the following steps:

Calculating the initial position vector and velocity vector: Using an available TLE file, the numerical values of orbital elements, which are available in the TLE file, are extracted. Using these orbital elements, the initial position vector and velocity vector will be obtained as follow : { } ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ ⎤ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ ⎡ Ω − Ω + Ω − Ω + Ω Ω Ω − Ω − Ω − Ω ⎪⎭ ⎪⎬ ⎫ ⎪⎩ ⎪⎨ ⎧ + = i i w i w i i w w i w w i i w w i w w e h cos sin cos sin sin sin cos cos cos cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos * 0 sin cos * cos 1 1 r 2 0 θ θ θ μ (1)

where θ is the initial value of true anomaly, e is initial eccentricity, w is the initial value of the argument of perigee, h is the magnitude of angular momentum, Ω is the initial value of RAAN, and μ is the standard gravitational parameter. B. Calculating new position and velocity vectors of the satellite: Using the initial position and velocity vectors, the new position and velocity vectors of the satellite will be calculated using (3) and (4) : { } { } { } 0 0 r v g r f + = (3) { } { } { } 0 0 v v g r f • • + = ,                       (4) where f and g  are the Lagrange coefficients. For calculating the Lagrange coefficients, the Kepler’s equation is solved
