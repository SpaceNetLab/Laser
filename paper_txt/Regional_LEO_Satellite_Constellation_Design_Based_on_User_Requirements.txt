Abstract‚ÄîIn the traditional satellite constellation design, it is
hard to Ô¨Ånd a suitable method to evaluate the user requirements
precisely and the existing algorithms result in a high computing
cost. In this paper, a method of designing and optimizing the
regional satellite constellation is proposed. The user requirements
are represented by the the number of users, which is established
based on communication markets and population distribution.
The design of satellite constellations is a multi-objective problem,
which can be solved through the proposed non-dominated sorting
genetic algorithm with elitist strategy. By constructing a satellite
constellation for the target area, the effectiveness of the method
has been veriÔ¨Åed. The simulation results show that compared with
OneWeb constellation, the proposed constellation design method
can effectively meet the user requirements with lower satellite
cost.
I. INTRODUCTION
Satellite networks are composed of one or several satellites,
exclusive earth stations and inter-satellite links (ISLs) [1]. The
network has advantages in wide area coverage, emergency
communication and high throughput capacity, which can fully
compensate for the shortage of ground communication system.
Satellites are the basic components of a satellite constella-
tion. According to the difference of orbital altitude that is de-
Ô¨Åned as the distance between satellites and earth, those nodes
are segmented into geosynchronous orbit (GEO) satellites,
medium earth orbit (MEO) or low earth orbit (LEO). The orbit
height of GEO satellites have a precise altitude of 35786km.
The MEO satellites have orbits with an altitude from 10000 to
20000km. And the orbit height of LEO satellites are generally
from 500 to 2000km. GEO satellites are relatively geosta-
tionary because of the same rate as rotation speed of earth,
therefore those nodes are capable of providing continuous
communication service to the same users. The coverage area
of a single satellite is large for the high orbit, therefore three
satellites can offer communication service for the whole world.
Furthermore, compared to other altitude orbits satellites, GEO
satellites are characterized by poor resolution, long time delay
to transmit data and expensive launch costs. More seriously,
the Ô¨Åxed orbits lead to the emergency of communication
blackout in the north and south poles. By contrast, low
earth orbit satellites take advantage of high resolution, low
emission cost, short propagation delay. However, a single LEO
satellite coverages small area and offers poor communication
service, so it‚Äôs signiÔ¨Åcant to use multiple satellites to form
a constellation. As a result, LEO satellite communication
constellations have attracted the attention of the world because
it can overcome weaknesses of the GEO satellites.
Nowadays, the existing LEO satellite constellations are
mostly aim to serve global communication markets like Iridi-
um and OneWeb system. They usually include many satellites,
which means a heavy Ô¨Ånancial burden for small countries and
regions. It‚Äôs impossible for those groups to afford large and
expensive constellation systems now, even in the future. On
the contrary, they have the power to build their own systems
to fulÔ¨Åll individual requirements for small coverage regions.
Therefore, the constellation design for regional coverage has
become present and future trends.
Satellite constellation design is a complicated process to
achieve precise satellite and orbit parameters such as type of
service, number of satellites, minimal elevation angle, orbit
height, etc [3]. In the process of constellation design and
optimization, there are great number of variables causing high
computational complexity. Therefore, it‚Äôs necessary to adopt
a basic constellation model (such as polar constellation model
and Walker constellation model) to reduce the dimension of
solution space. Many satellite constellation design methods
have been proposed, and most of them mainly focus on
satellite coverage. Reference [4] has designed a three layer
satellite communication architecture and reference [5] has pro-
posed a satellite constellation, which was across two satellite
orbits, and a basic constellation models for regional satellite
constellation design has been proposed in [6]. However, the
goal of those constellation design and optimization is coverage
optimization rather than the user requirements, which makes
that the constellation design is incompatible with the actual
requirements. Reference [7] has proposed a user requirement
model and capacity metrics, but the system model is aimed at
unmanned aerial vehicle constellations.
In this paper, the main contribution is a method of re-
gional constellation design which aims to use the minimum
number of satellites to achieve user requirements. The user
requirements on the target region is evaluated based on the
communication markets and population density. A system
model is build concerning the user requirements, overlay
weight, minimal elevation angle, and orbit height. Finally,
the optimization algorithm is achieving in MATLAB, and a
connection to STK is established to compute constellation
performance. The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows.

II. REGIONAL CONSTELLATION MODEL
In the process of the satellite constellation design, it‚Äôs
signiÔ¨Åcant to compare the users who are willing to subscribe
to the satellite network and the capacity of the users served
by the satellite networks. For meeting the requirements of the
user, the capacity of the constellation should be greater than
the real users. Therefore the user requirement model and the
constellation capacity metrics are established in this section,
and the satellite downlink is the main scene of the satellite
constellation design.
A. Basic constellation model
Satellite constellations are composed of a number of satel-
lites according to a certain conÔ¨Åguration, and those satellites
cooperate to achieve tasks about coverage performance and
communication service. Satellites are the core parts of the
constellation, therefore the process of constellation design is
to determine the satellite and constellation orbit parameters.
A satellite has six parameters consisting of orbit inclination
i, the right ascension of ascending node ‚Ñ¶, the argument of
perigee w, the semimajor axis a, eccentricity e, and the true
anomaly v [8]. Among them, the position of the orbit plane is
determined by i and ‚Ñ¶. The direction of the orbit is decided
by w. The size and shape of the orbit are determined by a
and e. And the position of the satellite at a certain time in the
orbit is determined by v.
LEO satellite constellation is intended to offer a great ser-
vice to the target area. The precondition for providing services
is to cover the target area, for a single satellite, coverage
capacity is one of the main standards, and the situation of
a single satellite coverage is shown in Figure 1. Wherein R
is the symbol of earth‚Äôs radius, h represents orbit height, œï
is the minimum elevation that is signiÔ¨Åcant to establish links
between satellites and the ground users, and œâ is a half of
geocentric angle of a satellite covered area.

The formula to calculate Œ∏ is
Œ∏ = arcsin(
R
R + h cos œï).
(1)
According to the spherical surface area formula, a single
satellite coverage S can be noted by
S = 2œÄR2[1 ‚àísin(œï + Œ∏)].
(2)
The coverage of the whole satellite constellation is com-
plicated concerning the overlaps between satellites, so the
concept of the constellation coverage ratio is given. The
formula to calculate œÅ can be expressed as
œÅ = Snet
Star
,
(3)
where Snet denotes the covered area and Star represents the
target area, respectively. Because of the complicated comput-
ing process and many related variables, STK is usually used
to calculate the performance of the satellites [9]. It is easy to
get precise numeric results without tedious calculation process
with the tool.
In the process of designing constellations which have many
satellites, it should consider the satellite parameters and ensure
the geometric conÔ¨Åguration of the constellation. The parame-
ters about the constellation design are number of orbit planes
NP , number of satellites per orbit plane Nsat, altitude of orbit
h, inclination of orbit Œ∏, relative spacing between satellites in
adjacent orbit planes [10]. There are basic constellation models
belonging to the symmetric constellation like polar orbit and
Walker orbit to reducing the computational complexity. In
symmetric constellation, satellite orbit plane distributes homo-
geneously and has the same number of satellites on each track.
In polar orbit constellation, the orbital inclination is above
90 degrees and all of the satellites can pass through north
and south poles in each circle [11]. However, in Walker orbit
constellation, the orbit inclination is usually from 40 degrees
to 60 degrees and it provides poor coverage performance to
the poles [12]. Both of the satellite conÔ¨Åguration possess
distinguishing features applying to different situations. The
satellites in Walker constellation enable uniform distribution
while the satellites of the polar orbit tend to the two poles of
the earth leading to poor coverage over the middle or lower
latitude areas. The deign of constellation is divided into the
global constellation design and the regional constellation de-
sign. For the sake of providing communication globally, many
countries and regions are incapable of developing gateway
stations around the world, so it‚Äôs necessary to deploy the
inter-satellite links to make up for the lack of earth stations.
In polar orbit, the position among the satellites is station-
ary which make sure the stability of the links. In contrast,
the position of the satellites in the Walker constellation is
changeable providing a bad situation for the developing of
ISL. However, the development of ground stations is beyond
the regional constellations‚Äô concern. Consequently, the polar
orbit is usually the basic conÔ¨Åguration for global coverage
while the Walker orbit is chosen to offer communication for
the region, so the Walker orbit is superior to polar orbit in the
regional constellation design.
B. User requirement model
User requirements are one of the major criterion for the
establishment of communication networks. When the constel-
lation design combines user requirements, it can bring better
user service and economic performance. However, in other

constellation design process, they usually consider satellite
coverage performance instead of user requirements, which
leads to resource waste and economic loss. In this section, a
user requirements model is proposed based on communication
markets and population distribution.
The user requirement model generates a map of users who
are willing to subscribes to the satellite networks. It will be
combined with the capacity model to estimated the number
of users. The total size of the users depend on the com-
munication market size, population distribution, and national
income of regions etc. The global population distribution
is available from the Center for international Earth Science
Information(CIESIN) and the digitized population map is with
1‚ó¶longitude by 1‚ó¶latitude resolution, as show in Fig. 2
Fig. 2.
The population distribution in 2016.
The function of the normalized population distribution den-
sity can be represented by
Ng
X
grid=1
D(grid) = 1,
(4)
where Ng denotes the number of the grid points, D(grid) is
the population distribution density, which contains the number
of potential users in the each earth grid.
Therefore, the requirement map can be written as
DM(grid) = fsatMnumberD(grid),
(5)
where Mnumber denotes the total communication users which
is primarily served by terrestrial communication networks.
fsat represents the scale factor of the satellite network users,
which may changes during the development of the satellite
communication networks.
C. Capacity model
The interference from other satellites is calculated by
I =
X
j‚ààNandjÃ∏=i
Psat,jGsat,jGj(

)2,
(6)
where Psat,j denotes the transmitted power from the jth
interfering satellite to the terminal, Gsat,j represents the gains
of the jth interfering satellite antennas, Gj is the receive gains
of the terminal antenna for the jth interfering satellite, the last
part indicates the free space path loss from the jth interfering
satellite to the terminal.
The capacity model is used to measure the number of
users served by the system. In the satellite communication
system, the capacity will introduced by the ratio of satellite
transmitting power to the user receiving power. By the analysis
above ,the single-user downlink capacity of the satellite to
the requirement map grid can be calculated as follows. The
satellite capacity Csat which is determined by the downlink
transmitting power, various losses, gain of the user antenna,
system noise temperature, required SNR, required rate, can be
found by
Csat = PsatGsatGLfLM ‚àíI
SNRkTRuser
,
(7)
where LM is the rain loss plus link margin, and Ruser is
the individual terminal data rate. SNR notes the signal-to-
noise ratio, and k is boltzmann constant. Psat represents the
transmitting power of the satellite which connects to the user,
Gsat is the antenna gain, G is the user gain, Lf is path loss.
Ctotal which represents the sum of served users in the satellite
communication network, can be expressed by
Ctotal = NP NsatCsat.
(8)
The combination of user requirements and capacity model
form the optimization constraints of the constellation design.
The constellation designed in this way are more appropriate
to the user‚Äôs requirements.
III. OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM AND ALGORITHM
Satellite constellation design is a complicated process to
achieve precise satellite and orbit parameters. In this section,
sorting genetic algorithm with elitist strategy(NSGA-II) is
applied to solve the constellation design and optimization
problem.
A. Optimization model
In the LEO satellite constellation, there are a large number
of parameters affect the system performance. More impor-
tantly, in this paper,the user requirements become a novelty
constraint condition besides conventional constrained. The
method of the regional constellation design aims to use the
minimum number of satellites to achieve user requirements,
therefore the combinatorial optimization model is represented
as

(15)
Œ∏max ‚â•Œ∏ ‚â•Œ∏min,
(16)
where Ctotal denotes the sum of served users in the satellite
communication network, the second half of the inequality is
the user numbers of the target area. œÅ0 denotes the required
coverage ratio in the second constraints. The Ô¨Ånal Ô¨Åve con-
straints place upper and lower bounds on each of the design
vector variables whose values are based on special mission.
In order to achieve better economic beneÔ¨Åts, the number of
satellites and orbit height need to be controlled in a limited
range. The orbit height of LEO satellites is usually less than
2000km. The Walker constellation is the basic constellation,
so the orbit inclination is from 40 degrees to 60 degrees. The
minimum communication elevation angle play an important
role in satellite communication system [13]. The aim of the
method is to design a regional constellation which minimizes
the number of satellites under the condition of meeting user
requirements and coverage requirements of the target area.
B. Solution
NSGA-II is one of the most popular multi-objective genetic
algorithms at present [14]. It reduces the complexity of the
non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and it has the advan-
tages of fast running speed and good convergence. Therefore,
it has become a good solution for satellite constellation opti-
mization problems.
The NSGA-II algorithm is modiÔ¨Åed so that it can address
the satellite constellation design problem [15]. The proposed
method has the following six major steps.
1) Initialize the population set and generate chromosome
coding. The chromosome for each solution x is
x = [NP /Nsat/œï/h/œâ].
(17)
Binary coding is used for the chromosome coding, the
number of coding bits are set to be[5/5/21/9/8]. The encoding
length depends on the range and accuracy of each inÔ¨Çuence
factor.
2) Non-Dominated sort. By using fast non-dominated sort-
ing method will improve computational speed complexity.
The initialized population is sorted based on non-domination,
it utilize the information about the set that an individual
dominate and the number of individuals that dominated the
individual.
3) Crowding distance. It takes place of the sharing function
to maintain population diversity and improve the robustness
of the algorithm. The individuals are selected based on rank
and crowding distance, so all the individuals in the popula-
tion are assigned a crowding distance value. The basic idea
behind the crowing distance is Ô¨Ånding the Euclidian distance
between each individual in a front based on optimization target
including the number of satellites, the capacity of the satellite
constellation and the coverage ratio.
4) Selection. The selection is carried out using a crowded-
comparison-operator, nondomination rank and local level
crowding distance for each individual are calculated. If the
non-domination rank of two random individuals is different,
the individual is selected with high non-domination rank, on
the other hand, if the non-domination rank of two random
individuals is the same, the individual with greater crowding
distance is selected.
5) Genetic operators. Real-coded GA‚Äôs use simulated binary
crossover operator for crossover and polynomial mutation. It
includes simulated binary crossover and polynomial mutation.
Simulated binary crossover simulates the binary crossover
observed in nature, and polynomial mutation is used for
genetic variation of chromosomes.
6) Recombination and selection. The offspring population is
combined with the current generation population and selection
is performed to set the individuals of the next generation.Since
all the previous and current best individuals are added in
the population, elitism is ensured. Population is now sorted
based on non-domination. The new generation is Ô¨Ålled by each
front subsequently until the population size exceeds the current
population size. And hence the process repeats to generate the
subsequent generations.
With the preceding analysis and method, the Ô¨Ånal satellite
constellation design will be acquired.
IV. SIMULATION AND RESULTS
In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed re-
gional constellation design method, a simulation experiment
is performed. China is the target region to design the LEO
satellite constellation. In this section, constellation conÔ¨Ågura-
tion and performance analysis are completed by STK. Several
basic parameters for NSGA-II are set in Table I.

According to the user requirements, the user rate is set to
1.544Mbps, and the antenna gain of user terminal is assumed
to 0 dB. On the other hand, the system noise temperature of
the user terminal is 135K and the 40 GHz band is considered
in the simulations. Because the coverage performance of a
single satellite is great, therefore the target area surface is
covered using a grid of 3 degrees multiplied 3 degrees. With
those conditions, the Ô¨Ånal optimized regional LEO satellite
constellation is proposed. In the following part, the proposed
constellation is compared with the OneWeb constellation.
A. The framework of satellite constellation
The goal of the regional satellite constellation design and
optimization is to build a constellation which uses the min-
imum number of satellites to meet the requirements of the
regional users. The existing constellations offer global service
which mean enormous manpower, materials and satellite re-
source. However, some small countries and regions cannot
afford the heaven Ô¨Ånancial burden. The proposed regional
satellite constellation design method provides a balance be-
tween cost and performance. Through the comparison between
the new regional constellation and the existing global con-
stellation, it shows the new regional constellation gets great
performance with less satellites.
The OneWeb is the representative of the global constel-
lation.OneWeb consists of 648 satellites including 18 orbit
planes and 36 satellites in each orbit plane. The satellite orbit
altitude is 1200km, which belongs to the LEO satellite constel-
lation facing to the global service. In addition, the minimum
communication elevation of the constellation is 50 degrees
[16]. Because the communication of the satellites is based on
ground gateway station or inter-satellite links, so the design
of global constellation should take the deployment of the two
infrastructure into account. However, few countries have the
capacity to build the stations all over the world, therefore the
communication between satellites depends on inter-satellite
links. Finally, the base constellation conÔ¨Åguration is polar orbit
for the stability of inter-satellite links.
Fig. 3.
The regional constellation.
On the contrary, the proposed regional satellite constellation
is based on Walker orbit because the ground gateway station
is deployed in the target region without the issues of territorial
authority. The inter-satellite links can be supplemented to the
ground stations, therefore Walker constellation is the basic
constellation in the design of regional constellation, which
have better coverage performance compared with polar orbit.
According to the result of NSGA-II, the proposed regional
constellation is shown as Fig. 3. The regional constellation
consists of 27 satellites including 9 orbit planes and 3 satellites
in each orbit plane. The satellite orbit altitude is 1650km,
which belongs to the LEO satellite constellation facing to
the regional service. In addition, the minimum communication
elevation of the constellation is 30 degrees.
B. Simulation analysis
For the task of regional coverage, the number of the regional
constellation is great less compared with OneWeb constella-
tion. The simulation results about coverage and elevation indi-
cate the regional constellation can meet the user requirements
of the target area. The coverage and communication elevation
of the satellite constellation is the important system perfor-
mance. The proposed regional constellation compares with
OneWeb constellation from the two aspects in the following
section.
1) Comparison of coverage
Satellites are capable for wide range of coverage, therefore
coverage is an signiÔ¨Åcant criteria for constellations. China is
the target area of the constellation design method, therefore
the coverage performance of this target conuntry is obtained
by STK. The coverage of OneWeb is shown as Fig. 4 and the
coverage of the regional constellation is shown as Fig. 5. The
coverage weight of the target area is 4 in OneWeb. However,
the coverage weight is same in the whole target area. While the
coverage weight of the target area is more than 1 but less than
2 in the regional constellation. The proposed constellation can
cover the whole area and the coverage performance is better in
crowded area than sparsely populated area. For the perspective
of coverage performance, the proposed constellation take full
account of the user requirements.

Fig. 5.
The coverage of the regional constellation.
In the satellite constellation, due to blocking and multipath
effects, electron Ô¨Çow attenuation, atmospheric absorption and
Ô¨Çashing have bad impact on satellite-user downlink. The
inÔ¨Çuence is mainly based on the distance of the link path
through the atmosphere. However, the distance is depend on
the orbit altitude and the communication elevation. With the
increase of the elevation, the communication is improved.
The communication elevation of the grid is shown as Fig.
6. According to the communication elevation, the proposed
constellation is worse than OneWeb, but it can meet the com-
munication requirement. From the aspect of cost, the regional
constellation can meet the requirements of communication in
a more economical way.
Fig. 6.
The comparison of the communication elevation.
The proposed regional constellation meet the user require-
ments with less satellite compared with OneWeb constellation.
The coverage performance of the regional constellation is
better than OneWeb constellation because of considering of
the distribution of users. And the regional constellation can
meet the communication needs of users with less satellites
compared with OneWeb constellation. The goal of the pro-
posed constellation design method is Ô¨Ånd the balance between
the system cost and performance, and the simulation results
indicate the effectiveness of the scheme.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a method of the regional satellite constellation
design is proposed. For meeting the user requirements and re-
ducing the design cost of the system, the regional constellation
is tight coupling with the number of users, which depends
on communication markets and population distribution. By
constructing a satellite constellation for the target area, the
effectiveness of the method has been veriÔ¨Åed. The simulation
results indicate that the constellation gets good performance
with fewer satellites compared with OneWeb constellation.
