stronger signals and move faster than medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites at about a 20,000 km altitude. Taking advantage of these features, LEO satellites promise to make contributions to navigation and positioning where global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are blocked as well as the rapid convergence of precise point positioning (PPP). In this paper, LEO-based optimal global navigation and augmentation constellations are designed by a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and genetic algorithm (GA), respectively. Additionally, a LEO augmentation constellation with GNSS satellites included is designed using the NSGA-III. For global navigation

conﬁguration need 264, 240, 210, 210, 200, 190 and 180 satellites with altitudes of 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400 and 1500 km, respectively. For global augmentation constellations at an altitude of 900 km, for instance, 72, 91, and 108 satellites are required in order to achieve a global average of four, ﬁve and six visible satellites for an elevation angle above 7 degrees with one Walker constellation. To achieve a more even coverage, a hybrid constellation with two Walker constellations is also presented. On this basis, the GDOPs (geometric dilution of precision) of the GNSS with and without an LEO constellation are compared. In addition, we prove that the computation eﬃciency of the constellation design can be considerably improved by using master–slave parallel computing.

Iridium show that, even on the lowest ﬂoor inside a building, the carrier-to-noise density power ratio (C/N0) from Iridium satellites ranges between 35 and 55 dB-Hz, which is approximately the same as GPS in an open sky environment . Stronger signals would make GNSS more resilient and resistant

Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845; doi:10.3390/rs12111845 www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845 2 of 21 reduces by 70%~90% the convergence time of the precise point positioning (PPP), and the tracking data of GNSS satellites from LEO satellites improves the accuracy of the precise orbit determination of GNSS by 70% . Thus, the LEO-augmented GNSS promises to make a considerable contribution to PNT services. The prerequisite of the LEO-augmented GNSS service is a well-distributed LEO satellite constellation augmentation or a standalone backup navigation system. LEO satellite constellations consist of small satellites. Small satellites have greater component capabilities and low developing, building and launching costs. Small satellites have led to the wider application of large constellations in space missions, such as in telecommunication, the survey of resources and climate and sustaining global information networks, as well as navigation . The construction of LEO constellations consisting of small satellites can be completed within a short time. However, because of the LEO’s much smaller footprint than the medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite, many more satellites would be needed in order to provide the same coverage as an MEO . The emerging mega-constellations proposed by SpaceX, Telesat and OneWeb for internet broadband are great opportunities for integrating communication and navigation, but their huge costs and redundancy make these constellations less attractive . With the ﬁrst successful launch of a trial satellite, China’s LEO-based augmentation system—Hongyan—is under construction . Therefore, the entire design routine of a well-distributed LEO global coverage constellation is important and in urgent demand. Among all the existing navigation constellations, the Walker conﬁguration is widely used in the global positioning system (GPS), Galileo, and global navigation satellite system (GLONASS), as well as the third-generation system of BDS (BDS-3) because of its symmetrical conﬁguration and favourable global coverage. Walker conﬁguration is denoted as N/P/F, where N represents the total number of satellites in a constellation, P is the number of orbital planes and F is an inter-plane phase parameter, signifying the relative location of the satellites in the adjacent plane . Besides this, many other conﬁgurations have also been ﬁgured out since the last century. Luders et al. introduced the streets-of-coverage design, in which the inclined circular orbit satellites were placed at the same altitude in a single plane, and several diﬀerent planes were selected to achieve local or global coverage .

algorithm paradigms based on the two parallel processes of master–slave and island models showed excellent approximations of the true Pareto frontier . Aiming at LEO satellites, Lang developed a LEO satellite constellation speciﬁcally for continuous coverage of the mid-latitude band . A regional augmentation system aiming at Chinese cities Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845 3 of 21 was designed by Zhang et al. in which the ﬂower and Walker conﬁgurations with a restricted phasing scheme, as well as deployment strategies, were compared . Furthermore, Shtark et al. proposed an optimization algorithm for regional positioning using a LEO satellite

The altitude of LEO satellites drops quickly due to the dense atmosphere if no orbital maneuver happens . Thus, the air drag eﬀect on satellite orbital elements was ﬁrst analyzed in order to roughly determine the altitude of a LEO constellation. Then, the optimal navigation constellation and augmentation constellation were designed. For a global navigation constellation, the two-objective functions are the GDOP and the number of satellites, while the decision variables are the number of satellites per plane, the number of planes and the corresponding inclination. The three- objective functions are the GDOP, the number of satellites and the satellite altitude, while the decision variables are the number of satellites per plane, the number of planes, the corresponding inclination and altitude. For a global augmentation constellation, the single-objective function is the global average of four, ﬁve and six visible satellites. The decision variables are the same as those of a navigation constellation but the range of satellites per plane and the number of planes diﬀer because fewer satellites are needed for the augmentation system. A LEO augmentation constellation with the GNSS was designed and the GDOPs of the GNSS with and without a LEO constellation were compared. The time of serial computing and parallel computing for navigation were compared. An optimal constellation under each speciﬁc condition was obtained and recommended. 3.1. Air Drag Eﬀects on LEO Satellites Air drag eﬀects on satellite orbital elements in 20 days at an altitude of 500 km~1100 km were analyzed using the Satellite Analysis Tool Kit (STK) software. The forces included the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld with zonal and tesseral harmonics up to degree 31 and order 31, ocean tides, solid tides, solar radiation pressure, Jacchia 1970 drag model and third-body gravity. The ratio of satellite

a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the semi-major axis, while the eﬀects on the other elements were negligible. Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845 8 of 21 When a satellite was placed at a 500 km altitude, the semi-major axis decreased by 8 km in 20 days. Drag eﬀects signiﬁcantly decreased with an increase in satellite altitude. The semi-major axis decreased just 30 m in 20 days when the satellite altitude was 900 km, which is acceptable for LEO constellation maintenance. According to this simulation analysis, a LEO constellation is better placed above a 900 km altitude. Table 1. Drag eﬀects on orbital elements in 20 days at an altitude of 500 km~1100 km.

LEO Global Navigation Constellation Design The altitude of a LEO satellite constellation is better when it is higher than 900 km and lower than 1500 km in order to avoid the radiation of the inner Van Allen radiation belt. Optimal constellations were designed every 100 km from 900 km to 1500 km. For the multi-objective optimization problem, the members were binary-coded. The decision variable ranges of two- and three-objective optimization are listed in Table 2. The inclination range of a near-polar constellation was randomly chosen from 75◦ to 105◦in order to narrow down the search space. S represents the number of satellites per plane, and P represents the number of planes. The ranges of these two variables were randomly selected, which made the total number of satellites lie between 150 and 450. The variable numbers of bits of two- and three-objective optimization are listed in Table 3. Parameter settings are listed in Table 4. Table 2.

Master–slave parallel computing was used for time saving. A satellite was regarded as visible when the elevation angle was larger than 7◦. The optimization process considered the Earth’s second zonal harmonic eﬃciency with a propagation interval of 60 s. For P planes in a constellation, P conﬁgurations were analyzed for the phase factor F from 0 to P −1. For a point rp on the earth surface at time t, the Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845 9 of 21 GDOP relative to constellation c is expressed as GDOP(rp, t, c). The maximum GDOP of all the points in the orbital period Tp of P conﬁgurations is minimized, which can be denoted by a ﬁtness function as Fitness1 = max t∈(0,TP) max F∈(0,P−1) max rP∈EarthGDOP(rP, t, c) (7) The second ﬁtness function is Fitness2 = s × p (8) The third ﬁtness function is Fitness3 = altitudes (9) The ﬁrst and second ﬁtness functions were used for a two-objective optimization; three ﬁtness functions were used for a three-objective function optimization. 3.2.1.

For altitudes of 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400 and 1500 km, the number of satellites was greater than 264, 252, 210, 210, 200, 190 and 200, respectively, when the GDOP in the optimal sets was, ﬁrst, smaller than three. Note that all the inclinations were around 90◦. Fewer satellites were needed for a global average GDOP smaller than three at a higher altitude.

number of satellites and the GDOP into consideration: W264/12/1 with an inclination of 88.54◦for the altitude of 900 km; W240/10/9 with an inclination of 85.64◦for the altitude of 1000 km; W210/10/7 with an inclination of 85.64◦for the altitude of 1100 km; W210/10/8 with an inclination of 85.64◦for the altitude of 1200 km; W200/10/1 with an inclination of 86.72◦for the altitude of 1300 km; W190/10/8 with an inclination of 88.55◦for the altitude 1400 km; and W180/10/1 with an inclination of 85.64◦for the altitude 1500 km. Satellites in space with these conﬁgurations are showed in Figure 6. The global average of visible satellites and the GDOP of the above-mentioned conﬁgurations in 24 h are listed in Table 5. The global visible satellites and the GDOP with latitudes are shown in Figure 7. It can be seen that the average visible satellites of all the altitudes are between 5 and 35; the average GDOPs of 1200 km and 1300 km are between 0.5 and 3; the GDOPs of other cases are between 0.5 and 5. The visible satellites of high altitudes are more than those of low latitudes because the inclination is near 90◦, and the minimum visible satellites at a low latitude are greater than ﬁve.

lay between 150 and 360, the GDOP between 1.4347 and 5.5911 and the altitude between 904.7058 km and 1476.4705 km. Taking the GDOP, the number of satellites and the altitude into consideration, the conﬁguration of W 252/12/1 with an inclination of 85.64◦and an altitude of 1008.23 km is recommended for the three-objective optimization. The constellation in space is shown in Figure 9. The average global visible satellites and the GDOP in 24 h were 18.31 and 1.54, respectively. Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845 11 of 21

Calculation Time of Parallel and Serial Computing Since the multi-objective optimization process is time-consuming, it is important to reduce the computation costs; for example, by a parallel computing technology. The running time of parallel and serial computing under two- and three-objective optimization conditions are calculated and presented in Table 6. Parallel computing is achieved with 60 computer cluster cores. For two-objective optimization with an altitude of 1400 km, serial computing requires 125.2513 h, while the parallel computing requires only 4.5805 h, making it 27.3 times faster than serial computing. For the three-objective optimization condition, parallel computing runs at 4.0083 h, which is 28.16 times faster than serial computing. Table 6.

LEO Global Augmentated Constellation Design The decision variable ranges of one constellation and a hybrid constellation for augmentation are listed in Table 7. For one Walker constellation, the constellation was designed every 100 km from altitudes of 900 km to 1500 km. For a Walker/Walker hybrid constellation, altitudes were selected as 900 km and 1200 km. The decision variable ranges and the variable number of bits are listed in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. Parameter settings were the same as those of a navigation constellation. Table 7.

visible satellites of four, ﬁve and six at an altitude of 900 km, respectively. Globally visible satellites and the average visible satellites with altitudes of these three conﬁgurations are presented in Figure 10. The space conﬁgurations of these constellations are shown in Figure 11. For global average visible satellites of four, visible satellites were 1~3 for latitudes of 60◦N~60◦S. Among the other latitudes, visible satellites were larger than four, which meant constellation at these areas was able to provide PNT services. For a global average of ﬁve visible satellites, areas of visible satellites between 1~3 were less than the global average of four visible satellites. For a global average of six visible satellites, visible satellites of 13 were achieved at high latitudes, and the visible satellites of almost half the areas were between 4~10. More satellites were always viewed at higher latitudes because of a near-polar conﬁguration, and uneven coverage was attained with only one Walker constellation.

Constellations for average of four, ﬁve and six visible satellites: (a) W72/8/1; (b) W91/7/2; (c) W108/9/1. The available percentages for navigation and average GDOP for four, ﬁve and six globally visible satellites are listed in Tables 9–11, respectively. The available percentage of navigation refers to the percentage of visible satellites that were greater than or equal to four in 24 h. Much fewer satellites were required for a global augmentation system than that of the navigation system. For a global average of four visible satellites, constellations at 1000 km/1200 km/1300 km/1400 km were retrograde orbits, and the constellation at 1300 km got the smallest average GDOP of 7.76. For a global average of ﬁve visible satellites, constellations at 900 km/1200 km/1300 km/1500 km were retrograde orbits, and the average GDOP of the constellation at 1500 km was less than ﬁve. For a global average of six visible satellites, constellations at 1000 km/1200 km were retrograde orbits, and the average GDOP of the constellation at 1300 km got the smallest GDOP of 5.10. With the global average of visible satellites increasing from four to ﬁve and six, the available percentages of navigation rose from approximately 40% to 50% and 60%, respectively. Table 9.

Walker/Walker Constellation The augmentation constellations described above were able to achieve global averages of four, ﬁve and six visible satellites. However, the visible satellites were uneven due to the near-polar conﬁguration. To achieve a more even global coverage, a hybrid constellation constructed with two Walker constellations was designed. The inclination of one constellation was set between 0◦and 45◦, and the altitude was 900 km; the inclination of the other constellation was set between 45◦and 90◦, and Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845 15 of 21 the altitude was 1200 km. The globally visible satellites and the average visible satellites with latitudes for an average of four, ﬁve and six visible satellites are presented in Figure 12. With two constellations, a much more even coverage was obtained. The space conﬁgurations and parameters of these three hybrid conﬁgurations are listed in Figure 13 and Table 12, respectively. For a global average of six visible satellites, the percentage of this hybrid constellation capable of providing PNT services was 95.58%, and the global average GDOP was 12.81. Table 11.

of global visible satellites. However, as the GNSS is the mainstream of the PNT, the GDOPs of the GNSS with and without LEO satellites are worth studying. In this section, with the four GNSSs, an optimal LEO Walker/Walker constellation was designed using the NSGA-III, based on two objectives: GNSS/LEO GDOP and number of LEO satellites, i.e., Fitness1 and Fitness2. The decision variables of the LEO satellites were the same as those in Section 3.3.2 The satellite parameters of GPS, BDS, Galileo and GLONASS were based on documents , respectively.

Altitude (km) Conﬁguration Inclination (deg) 900 W16/4/1 34.28 1200 W40/5/1 70 With 56 LEO satellites introduced in the GNSS, the mean GDOP of the GNSS with latitude decreased from 0.8882~1.0325 to 0.6438~0.8743, the maximum GDOP of the GNSS with latitude decreased from 1.1695~1.6264 to 1.0361~1.5611 and the minimum GDOP of the GNSS with latitude decreased from 0.6880~0.8670 to 0.4962~0.5533. The global mean GDOP of the GNSS decreased from 0.9549 to 0.8048; the global maximum GDOP of the GNSS decreased from 1.6264 to 1.5611 and the global minimum GDOP of the GNSS decreased from 0.6880 to 0.4962. Moreover, we arrived at the

on the semi-major axes of the satellites, whose altitudes were lower than 900 km. For satellites with an altitude of 500 km, the semi-major axis decreased by 8 km in 20 days. The semi-major axis decreased by 31 meters for satellites with an altitude of 900 km. With a suitable altitude range, global navigation constellations were designed with two-objective

recommended for two-objective optimization: for an altitude of 900 km, the conﬁguration of W264/12/1 with an inclination of 88.54◦; for an altitude of 1000 km, W240/10/9 with an inclination of 85.64◦; for an altitude of 1100 km, W210/10/7 with an inclination of 85.64◦; for an altitude of 1200 km, W210/10/8 with an inclination of 85.64◦; for an altitude of 1300 km, W200/10/1 with an inclination of 86.72◦; for an altitude of 1400 km, W190/10/8 with an inclination of 88.55◦; and for an altitude of 1500 km, W180/10/1 with an inclination of 85.64◦. For global navigation with three-objective optimization, a conﬁguration of W252/12/1 with an inclination of 85.64◦and altitude of 1008.23 km is recommended. Then, LEO-based augmentation constellations were designed using the GA. First, a constellation with one Walker constellation was designed. For a global average Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845 19 of 21 of four visible satellites, 72/65/63/56/52/50/48 satellites were needed for altitudes of 900 km/1000 km/1100 km/1200 km/1300 km/1400 km/ and 1500 km, respectively. For a global average of ﬁve visible satellites, 91/84/77/70/66/60/56 satellites were needed for altitudes of 900 km/1000 km/1100 km/1200 km/1300 km/1400 km/ and 1500 km, respectively. For a global average of six visible satellites, 108/100/91/90/78/75/70 satellites were needed for altitudes of 900 km/1000 km/1100 km/1200 km/1300 km/1400 km/ and 1500 km, respectively. With the global average of visible satellites increasing from four to ﬁve and six, the available percentage for navigation increased approximately from 40% to 50% and 60%. Note that it was hard to achieve even global coverage with one constellation. Therefore, a Walker/Walker hybrid constellation was designed.

available percentage of navigation of an average of six visible satellites was 95.58%. A hybrid Walker/Walker LEO constellation along with GNSS satellites was designed using the

in the GNSS, the global mean GDOP of the GNSS decreased from 0.9549 to 0.8048; the global maximum GDOP of the GNSS decreased from 1.6264 to 1.5611; and the global minimum GDOP of the GNSS decreased from 0.6880 to 0.4962. Note that even though only a small range of GDOP was improved, the main contribution of LEO satellites was to reduce the convergence time of the GNSS PPP and provide a backup PNT service where GNSS signals were blocked or interfered with.

able to ﬁnd the optimal front of constellation design. Parallel computing shortens the running time considerably. With parallel computing, the NSGA-III under a 1400 km altitude and three-objective optimization runs 27.3 and 28.16 times faster, respectively, than serial computing.

With the completion of the construction of China’s BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS) in 2020, all global navigation satellite systems will be capable of oﬀering global service . Along with two regional navigation satellite systems—the quasi-zenith satellite system (QZSS) from Japan and navigation with Indian constellation (NavIC) from India—medium/geosynchronous/inclined geosynchronous orbit satellites, whose altitudes are approximately 20,000 km, constitute the satellite navigation system. However, due to the weak signals of these satellites, the positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) services, on which many critical infrastructures are heavily dependent, are easily disrupted in a deeply attenuated environment or can be interfered with by a jammer . To avoid this limitation, the low Earth orbit (LEO)-augmented global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has attracted

in advance in order to get a better understanding of reference point distance sorting. The routine of crowding distance sorting is as follows: ﬁrstly, objective functions are sorted for individuals in every non-domination layer. The maximum and minimum for the m-th objective function are denoted as f max m and f min m , respectively. Next, crowding distance id is calculated as ( f i+1 m −f i−1 m )/( f max m −f min m ). An individual with a larger crowding distance is sent to the next generation. With a fast non-dominating and crowding distance sorting, the NSGA-II is able to reduce the computational complexity of the NSGA and preserve elitism. However, with an increase in objectives, on the one hand, the identiﬁcation of neighbors could be rather diﬃcult, which means crowding distance sorting lacks diversity preservation; on the other hand, the searching process could be rather time-consuming. With a strategy change in reference point distance sorting, the NSGA-III is able to alleviate the problems of sticking to multiple local fronts, the computationally expensive identiﬁcation of neighbours and the diﬃculty in creating new solutions when it concerns an increase in the number of objectives. More comparisons of the NSGA-II and NSGA-III are listed in the reference section . For NSGA-III, the algorithm starts with a random population P0 of size N, and after being sorted by non-domination, each member in this population is assigned a rank. Then, the main loop starts with an oﬀspring Pt created from P0 by the usual cross and mutation operators. After this, Pt combines with its oﬀspring Qt to form a population Rt = Pt ∪Qt of size 2N. Rt undergoes a routine of fast non-dominated sorting and reference point distance sorting. Fast non-dominated sorting sorts individuals in Rt into l layers such as F1, F2, . . . , Fl, as shown in Figure 3, for two-objective optimization. Individuals in the same layer are non-dominated by each other; otherwise, for a minimum optimization problem, individuals in F2 are dominated by individuals in F1, i.e., individuals in F1 dominate individuals in F2. After fast non-dominated sorting, individuals with lower non-dominated ranks are merged into St until the size of St is greater than or equal to N. If the size of St is greater than N, Pt+1 = St and the procedure moves into the next generation. Otherwise, Pt+1 = ∪l−1 j=1Fj and k individuals are selected from Fl, k = N − Pt+1 . Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845 6 of 21 Figure 3. Non-dominated sorting. Reference point distance sorting is performed on individuals in Fl to determine which k individuals are selected. Reference point distance sorting includes four sections: determination of reference points on a hyper-plane, adaptive normalization of population members, association operation and niche-preservation operation. Firstly, for a three-objective problem with four divisions, widely distributed reference points are chosen for each objective axis which are produced using Das and

repeatable ground tracks . The orbits in a ﬂower constellation can be elliptical or circular, and the constellation can have zonal or global coverage, depending on the speciﬁc mission requirements. The satellites in the constellation share the same repeating ground track, perigee altitude, inclination and argument of perigee. Traditionally, analytical methods were mainly adopted in early constellation designs due to only a few satellites and the need for simple earth coverage. However, now, with hundreds or even thousands of satellites and the requirements of diﬀerent tasks in a constellation, there is always a set of optimal solutions rather than one best solution. Therefore, constellation design has become a non-linear and multi-objective optimization problem. Multi-objective optimization problems mean there is always a trade-oﬀbetween objectives like the number of satellites and earth coverage. One of the tools which has proved to be eﬀective in solving this problem is the genetic algorithm (GA). By combining several weighted objective functions into a single function, Ely et al. applied the GA for zonal elliptical streets of coverage in constellation

broadband constellations—SpaceX, OneWeb and Telesat—were compared, and the total system throughput and minimum ground stations to support the system throughput were calculated by Portillo ID et al. . Aiming at LEO-based even global coverage augmentation systems, Ma et al. designed an optimal hybrid conﬁguration of 100 LEO satellites. Besides this, the necessary number of satellites for diﬀerent visible satellites and the elevation mask angle were studied using the GA . In the future, a LEO satellite constellation could either be an augmentation system in the environment, where the GNSS PNT service degrades, or a stand-alone backup navigation system, where the GNSS PNT service is not available. Therefore, it is essential to design LEO satellite constellations to fulﬁl both aspects. The Walker constellation is preferred for navigation because of its symmetrical conﬁguration. For a LEO-based global navigation constellation, a polar or near-polar inclination is required. A polar constellation might increase the chance of collision in the polar region, especially in a large constellation. Consequently, a near-polar Walker constellation is adopted in this paper. With the near-polar Walker constellation, a global navigation constellation solely consisting of LEO satellites is designed under two situations: one is the two-objective optimization case, including the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP), measuring the constellation geometry and number of satellites, and the other is the three-objective optimization case including the number of satellites, the GDOP and satellite altitude. The NSGA-III, a reference-based NSGA-II, is used for the two- and three-objective navigation constellation design. For any LEO-augmented constellation with a speciﬁc altitude, the single objective is the global average of visible satellites; therefore, the GA is adopted for the augmented constellation design. Since it is hard to achieve an even global coverage with a single near-polar Walker constellation, a hybrid constellation with Walker/Walker constellation is designed for an even global coverage. Furthermore, the Walker/Walker LEO constellation is designed with the consideration of GNSS satellites, and the GDOPs of GNSS with and without LEO constellation are compared. Since the

improve computing eﬃciency. This paper mainly gives solutions to LEO navigation constellation design every 100 km for altitudes of 900 km~1500 km. Besides this, LEO augmentation constellations are designed every 100 km for altitudes of 900 km~1500 km from the global average visible satellites perspective. In addition, the

2.1. Problem Description A Walker conﬁguration has been widely used in navigation systems due to its symmetrical distribution and favourable global coverage. Owing to a remarkable diﬀerence in the footprints of a LEO and MEO, as shown in Figure 1, many more satellites would be required in order to provide global coverage. The nadir-pointing coverage circle area A of a satellite is calculated as A = 2πR2h/(R + h); R (6378.14 km) is the radius of Earth and h is the satellite altitude. For instance, taking the MEO altitude as 20,200 km and the LEO altitude as 900 km, the ratio of the footprint areas of MEO/LEO is 6.146. Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845 4 of 21 Figure 1. Footprints of LEO (low Earth orbit) satellite versus MEO (medium Earth orbit) satellite. In the problem description section, the Walker conﬁguration and the factor-GDOP of measuring the positioning performance for a satellite constellation are described. 2.1.1. Walker Pattern A Walker pattern constellation is described by three integers as N/P/F, where N denotes the total number of satellites in the constellation, P is the number of orbital planes and F is the phasing parameter, which deﬁnes the relative position of the satellites in the adjacent plane and values between 0 and P-1. Satellites in a Walker constellation are uniformly distributed in space. For instance, the distribution of satellites in the Iridium system, which is a Walker constellation, is depicted in Figure 2. These satellites share the same semi-major axis, inclination, eccentricity and argument of perigee. The right ascension of the ascending nodes (RAAN) and the mean anomaly of the j-th satellites on the i-th plane are described by the following formulas : Ωij = 2π P (i −1) (1) Mij = 2π S (j −1) + 2π N F(i −1) (2) where S = N/P represents the number of satellites per plane, Ωis the RAAN and M is the mean anomaly. As such, satellites in a Walker conﬁguration are speciﬁcally located. Figure 2. Iridium constellation. 2.1.2. GDOP The problem of determining the user position, which concerns three unknown variables (i.e., Cartesian coordinates x, y, z), is solved through the known positions of navigation satellites. Usually, there is a time oﬀset for the receiver clock; so, there are four unknown variables instead of three, meaning that there should be at least four satellites in sight at any time for determining the position of the user. The user position error is described as : σ = GDOP · σUERE (3) where the GDOP solely depends on the relative locations of the satellites and the user. σUERE is the pseudo-range error factor, mainly including the eﬀects of the satellite clock, ionosphere error, troposphere error, receiver noise and multi-path. GDOP ranges from zero to inﬁnity (∞), and the Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1845 5 of 21 geometry is ideal when GDOP tends towards 0. The larger the GDOP value is, the poorer the geometry of the satellite constellation. 2.2. Methods In order to get the optimal parameters to describe a Walker constellation, NSGA-III, one of the GAs, is used in this paper. GA mimics Darwin’s theory of evolution, creating oﬀspring through a procedure of cross, mutation and ﬁtness selection. The procedure begins by producing a random population, and each individual, coded by a chromosome, represents a possible solution to the problem. The chromosome could be binary-coded or real-coded. For a binary-coded chromosome, cross techniques may be a one-point or two-point crossover. With a cross probability, two parent chromosomes exchange the bits after the point with one-point crossover and the bits between the points with two-point crossover to create two new oﬀspring. With the new oﬀspring, a mutation technique changes a random gene of the chromosome to create a new oﬀspring with a mutation probability. For a binary-coded chromosome, the gene changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. A mutation technique introduces new members to the population and prevents prematurity. Better individuals are preserved to the next generation in accordance with their ﬁtness functions. For a minimum problem, individuals with smaller ﬁtness functions are carried on to the next generation. This loop of cross, mutation and ﬁtness functions stops when the maximum generation or a stop criterion is met. For a multi-objective

and the size of population must be the same as the number of reference points. Secondly, as the objectives are always in diﬀerent units, they are normalized. Each minimum for M objective functions Zmin i are found to get them translated into objectives f ′ i (x) = fi(x) −zmin i . With f ′ i (x), extreme points are calculated as: ASF(x, w) = maxM i=1 f ′ i (x)/wi, x ∈St (4) zi,maxargmins∈StAii−6i j (5) Then, M extreme objective vectors Zi,max are made to constitute a linear hyper-plane. With this hyper-plane, the intercept ai of extreme vectors on the i-th objective axis can be computed. Therefore, the objective functions can be normalized using the following equation: f n i (x) = f ′ i (x) ai −zmin i fi(x)−zmin i ai−zmin i (6) After this normalization, the perpendicular distance of each individual in St is calculated from each of the reference lines, which is joined by the reference point with the origin on the hyper-plane. Then, the reference point with the smallest distance is associated with the individual. The niche count of a reference point is calculated, except for the last-domination layer, i.e., Fl, and the niche count can be zero or more than one. Individuals associated with the reference point that has the lowest niche count should be preserved to ensure population diversity. The reference point with the lowest niche count is selected to ﬁnd out whether this point is associated with the individuals in Fl. If not, another reference point is selected until at least one individual in Fl is associated. If none of the individuals in Pt+1 are associated with the selected reference point, the individual with the minimum perpendicular distance in Fl is selected; otherwise, a random individual in Fl is selected since the population diversity has already been assured. The niche preservation operation stops once k individuals are selected in Fl. As such, the size of St is N, and the one loop of mutation, cross, non-dominated sorting and reference point distance sorting completes. This loop continues until the maximum generation or a stop criterion has been met. A ﬂow chart of the NSGA-III in parallel processing is presented in Figure 4.

range even when more LEO satellites were introduced. 4. Conclusions The premise of a LEO navigation system or a LEO-augmented GNSS system is a well-distributed global coverage LEO constellation. For a LEO-based navigation constellation, the GDOP and the number of satellites need to be considered. For a LEO-based global augmentation constellation, the global average of visible satellites is required. With one Walker conﬁguration, it was hard to get even global coverage. Therefore, a hybrid Walker/Walker constellation was designed. The GDOPs of the GNSS with and without LEO satellites were compared. To achieve a suitable altitude for the LEO constellation, the air drag eﬀects on satellites at altitudes

LEO-based navigation constellations with a Walker conﬁguration need 180~264 satellites for altitudes of 1500 km~900 km in order to achieve a global average GDOP of less than three; LEO-based augmentation constellations with a Walker conﬁguration need fewer satellites than navigation constellation to realize global averages of four, ﬁve and six visible satellites. Nevertheless, due to the constraint of global coverage, LEO-based augmentation constellations with a single Walker conﬁguration ﬁnd it hard to achieve even global even coverage. Instead of a single Walker conﬁguration, a hybrid Walker/Walker constellation is able to achieve a more even global coverage.
