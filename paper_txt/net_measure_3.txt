Abstract—Low Earth orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) have
been advocated as a key infrastructure for truly global cov-
erage in the forthcoming 6G. This paper presents our initial
measurement results and observations on the end-to-end network
characteristics of Starlink, arguably the largest LSN constellation
to date. Our findings confirm that LSNs are a promising solution
towards ubiquitous Internet coverage over the Earth; yet, we also
find that the users of Starlink experience much more dynamics in
throughput and latency than terrestrial network users, and even
frequent outages. Its user experiences are heavily affected by
environmental factors such as terrain, solar storms, rain, clouds,
and temperature, so is the power consumption. We further
analyze Starlink’s current bent-pipe relay strategy and its limits,
particularly for cross-ocean routes. We have also explored its
mobility and portability potentials, and extended our experiments
from urban cities to wild remote areas that are facing distinct
practical and cultural challenges.
I. INTRODUCTION
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites operate at around 180 km
to 2,000 km above the Earth surface, which, compared to
traditional Geosynchronous orbit (GEO) satellites at around
35,780 km, enable shorter delays and higher throughput for
space-ground communications, albeit with smaller coverage.1
A large number of LEO satellites can form a LEO Satellite
Network (LSN) constellation that collectively offers high-
quality services to ground users with truly global coverage. It
has been suggested as a key infrastructure towards the upcom-
ing 6G networking and beyond [1]. We have seen commercial
deployment of LSN constellations in the past decade with
rapidly growing attention from the general public. One of the
industrial leaders OneWeb, is building a constellation of 648
broadband satellites, which would eventually expand to 7,000.2
Its rival, SpaceX’s Starlink, has launched more than 2,000
satellites to LEO and has received approval from the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) to bring that number up
to 12,000. FCC has further authorized Starlink to launch 7,500
generation 2 satellites in the near future.3 The next-generation
Starlink constellation may eventually harbor up to 30,000.4
Yet, LSNs remain in their early stages with limited user
bases and user experiences. There are novel theoretical and
simulation-based studies on satellite communications for both

GEO and LEO. However, few comprehensive studies exist
with deep insights into the practical performance of large-
scale LSNs, except for scattered discussions in forums or with
simulations [2], [3]. The complex and dynamic topologies,
as well as the heterogeneous and black-box architectures
incurred during incremental deployment, further complicate
how outstanding LSNs perform. To accelerate the design,
deployment, and optimization of LSNs, a systematic measure-
ment is indispensable, though challenging.
We present our initial results and observations on a sys-
tematic LSN measurement study. We focus on the Starlink
network, which is arguably the largest LSN constellation to
date, in terms of both the number of satellites and the user
base. We are particularly interested in the end-to-end network
characteristics and performance with diverse configurations
and applications. These are also the focus of most general
users of the Internet, the mass consumer market that is targeted
by Starlink. As a matter of fact, the Starlink network operator,
SpaceX, offers a plug-and-play black-box service to common
end users, who can simply connect to a Starlink router through
WiFi or Ethernet, without knowing the satellite communication
details and the constellation operations. We are therefore
interested in the following key questions:
• Can today’s Starlink achieve comparable performance as
a typical modern terrestrial network does for end users?
• What are the key influential factors of the Starlink net-
work services as perceived by end users?
• Has Starlink achieved global coverage through its con-
stellation? If not, what are the challenges?
Our Starlink measurement, involving four dishes, has lasted
over half a year starting from the beginning of 2022. We use
scripts to automate various tools and applications to communi-
cate to servers distributed in different regions worldwide. We
have performed field tests in urban cities and remote wild areas
with a per-region collection of over 3 million total records. Our

findings confirm that LSNs are a promising solution towards
ubiquitous Internet coverage over the Earth; yet, we also
identify a series of significant issues on the current Starlink’s
network services; in particular, the following observations: (1)
The throughput and latency experienced by a Starlink user are
much more dynamic compared to terrestrial networks; outages
are frequent, too. (2) Starlink’s user experience can be heavily
affected by environments such as terrain, solar storm, rain,
cloud, and temperature, so is its power consumption.
We are also interested in the impact of the constellation’s
topology. Instead of establishing Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs)
between satellites, Starlink is currently using a bent-pipe
strategy [4], [5], where a LEO satellite must relay the traffic
to a Ground Station (GS) for further routing [6], as shown in
Fig. 1. We have validated that the bent-pipe is generally of one
hop instead of multiple and involves only the closest GS before
switching to the terrestrial network. We analyze the potential
limits of this strategy, particularly for cross-ocean routes.
We also examine Starlink’s mobility and portability support.
Even though throughput does not change much during move-
ment, our experiments suggest that mobility with Starlink still
requires significantly more work as outages happen frequently
with high latency. We further extend our measurements from
urban cities to the wild remote areas which reveal a series of
issues regarding global coverage, including unique practical
and cultural challenges.
II. RELATED WORK
There have been many pioneering works on satellite com-
munications, from theoretical analysis [7]–[10], to system
design [4], [5], [11]–[13], and to practical deployment [14]–
[16]. Early measurement on real-world practical systems or
simulations have focused on GEO satellite networking [17],
[18]. Ground-to-satellite distance and hence the signal latency
is a physical barrier that can only be alleviated by moving
to the LEO. In the past decade, LEO constellations have re-
ceived much attention as a means towards ubiquitous Internet
connectivity beyond 5G. Extensive studies have been done on
the interaction between LEO satellites to ground stations [15],
[16], [19]–[21], constellation topology management, address-
ing and routing [9] [22], as well as the potential impact of
environmental factors, such as rain [15] and solar storms [23].

from newsmedia and user forums,5 most of which were simple
reviews. Studies on LEO constellation networks have largely
relied on simulators, such as Hypatia [2] and StarPerf
[3]. They are good for model and design validation, but real-
world measurement for such large-scale complex systems as
Starlink is irreplaceable. We have seen earlier measurements
[24]–[28], which were conducted with relatively simple se-
tups and limited dynamics of influential factors, and often
focused on physical layer behaviors. Recent measurement
works have been done with Ookla’s speedtest6 and a browser
extension [29], [30]. They have examined QUIC performance
and browser latency with Starlink. Our work, in parallel time
as theirs, attempts to provide a systematic measurement on
Starlink’s performance from the common end users’ per-
spective. Our measurement has a more global coverage with
distant endpoints, and considers video streaming, remote wild
northern areas, and power consumption.
III. SYSTEM SETUP AND METHODOLOGY
A. Starlink Network Overview
SpaceX’s Starlink is a prominent representative of the
state-of-the-art LEO satellite networks, serving over 400,000
subscribers worldwide as of today. Its system consists of three
main components: a constellation of LEO satellites, a network
of ground stations, and user terminals. The constellation
currently has over 2,000 satellites at different LEO groups,
known as shells [2], [5]. Most of the deployed satellites are in
the first shell, which contains 72 orbits at an altitude of 550
km in planes inclined 53°, each accommodating a maximum
of 22 satellites (see Fig. 2(a)).
The satellites employ phased array beamforming and digital
processing in the Ku- and Ka-bands for data communications
[31]. Instead of directly connecting from handsets to satel-
lites, a dish (nicknamed as Dishy McFlatface) is needed to
communicate through a User Link (UL) with a LEO satellite
that is visible and accessible, and the dish then serves local
user devices. Two generations of dishes are available for
consumers: the round-shaped Gen 1 and the rectangular Gen
2. Gen 1 spans 23.2” in diameter and weighs in at 7.3 kg,
whereas Gen 2 is slightly smaller (19” x 12”) and lighter
(4.2 kg) with more bandwidth streams in the router (3x3 MU-
MIMO versus 2x2 in Gen 1). The latter has better portability
but remains bulky. Not only the sky needs to be clear, but the
setup location needs to be wide enough to accommodate the
dish size and any movement required for tilt self-adjustment.

A visibility map provided by the Starlink app can help with
the placement (see Fig. 3 for an example), which also gives a
numerical obstruction ratio in its debug page. We have used
both dishes in our measurement and found that their network
services experienced by end users are largely similar, though
Gen 2 seems more friendly to TCP.
Different from early satellite services that often serve a
niche market, Starlink targets the next generation broadband
Internet service for the global consumer market. End users are
provided a plug-and-play Internet access interface that hides
the technical details of satellite communications. The user kit
consists of three main components: the dish, a power-over-
Ethernet power supply adapter, and a router with WiFi and
Ethernet port (Gen 1) or WiFi only (Gen 2) for local devices.
A particular satellite connecting to the dish at a time will act
as a repeater, relaying the signal through the Ka-band to a
Ground Station (GS) through a GS-to-Satellite Link (GSL),
which further connects to the global Internet, or vice versa
(see Fig. 2(b)). Currently, there are at least 65 GSes located
in North America and 23 GSes in Europe, as well as others
scattered worldwide.7 To successfully establish this bent-pipe
for traffic relay, the GS and the dish must both be in the
field of view of the satellite at the same time. Therefore, their
distance should not exceed about 1,000 km. Also note that
a LEO satellite has a fly-over dwell time of only around 10
minutes over one spot on the ground [15]; when it moves out,
the service needs to be handover to a new satellite moving into
the area (if there is). Starlink has started laser-based ISL (Inter-
Satellite Link) experiments; yet large scale implementation
will not happen till the end of 2022 [32].
B. Measurement Topology and Environment
Our measurement study started in January 2022 and lasted
7 months. We have deployed 4 dish kits in different locations
for data generation, communication, and collection. Among
them, three are Gen 1 (referred to as A, B, and C, respectively)
and one is Gen 2 (referred to as F) which is easier to carry
to remote areas. Our experiments span over a wide range of
terrains, including major cities, namely Vancouver (Burnaby
and Coquitlam in Metro Vancouver, in particular) in British
Columbia (BC), Canada, with open sky spaces, remote areas
with steep valleys or at the far north (Koeye Point, BC,
which is near the current service boundary of Starlink), and
temperate rain forests with heavy obstacles. Dish A and B are
stationed in Burnaby whereas dish C is setup in Coqutilam,
and Dish F is stationed at Koeye Point. To collect measurement
data with minimum signal, workload interference, and power
demands, a Raspberry Pi 4B (Raspi) was directly connected
to each Starlink router through an Ethernet cable, except for
dish F which has a WiFi interface only. We have performed
measurements to 9 destination servers deployed using Amazon
Web Services (AWS), which are geo-distributed worldwide:

For the experiments where domestic terrestrial Internet
access is available, we have used a PC with an i7-10700KF
CPU and the same AWS server regions as the baseline for
comparison. The baseline presented in this paper is running
over a terrestrial Cable service with a maximum download
speed of 800 Mb/s. We have experimented with different
terrestrial broadband Internet services of similar maximum
speeds, and have observed similar baseline performance. We
also have used an Emporia smart plug8 to monitor the in-
stant and historical power consumption of the dish kit. To
understand the impact of weather conditions, we extract hourly
data from a climate station at Vancouver Harbour, which is
approximately 10 km away from dish A.
C. Target Applications and Measurement Tools
Our measurement cover different protocols and applications,
from Web browsing and file transfer to high-demand video
streaming. We use iperf3 to measure the TCP and UDP
throughput in the transport layer with cubic TCP as the
default, though, further studies would be conducted to compare
other variants. For each destination server, two iperf3 are
launched at different ports for downloading and uploading,
respectively, allowing simultaneous measurements of both.
We also use the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) to copy files
with different data sizes bi-directionally to the AWS regions.
fallocate has been used to create files with data sizes
ranging from 1 to 300 MB. ping and traceroute have
been used to track and analyze the network path characteristics
and routing strategies. We have used the Starlink Mobile App
and YouTube’s built-in tool Stats for nerds to collect
related network, user, and application information. Python-
based scripts automate the tests and collect output data which
will be made publicly available.
IV. URBAN CITY MEASUREMENT: STARLINK VERSUS
TERRESTRIAL NETWORKING
We start our measurement in Vancouver, a major city at the
Pacific West Coast with all the state-of-the-art terrestrial Inter-
net infrastructures and Starlink coverage. We have deployed
the dishes in different locations in the city’s residential areas
with sufficient open surrounding spaces, and hence should
reveal the best performance of Starlink.

A. End-to-End Latency
We have measured the latency across 9 AWS regions
worldwide and looked at the difference between Starlink and
the terrestrial network’s latency. In summary, we have found
that Starlink’s latency is slightly higher (10%) than that of the
terrestrial network on average and is much more unstable (see
Fig. 4, 5). Obstruction, satellite movements, and ISP routing
decisions are potential factors that affect Starlink’s latency.
1) Latency across Regions: We observe noticeable latency
gaps between Starlink and the terrestrial network in Fig. 4 with
the average gaps shown in TABLE I. They typically range
from 1.8 to 22.8 ms away from the terrestrial network, with
Sydney being an outlier (3.4x to 43.6x larger gap). Bahrain
observes a noticeable increase in delay, but since the terrestrial
network also observes such an increase, the dish is likely not
the culprit. This could be due to a temporary connection issue
with the AWS server at Bahrain. Starlink’s latency being often
above that of the terrestrial network suggests that only a small
number of hops increase this latency, coinciding with the idea
of the single bent-pipe transmission framework, i.e., only the
first hop uses a bent-pipe [14]. Otherwise, if multiple bent-pipe
transmissions are involved, Starlink and the terrestrial network
would observe a larger variation in the latency discrepancy,
and Starlink would have lower latency to some destinations.
Sydney being an outlier also reaffirms this. When Starlink
started accepting requests for a Maritime version of their dish9
in July 2022, its coverage map only spans across the coastal
waters around in-land regions. A switch to a terrestrial network
would be required to cross the Atlantic or Pacific oceans

through submarine fibre. For example, to communicate with
Sydney, Starlink currently chooses to route packets through a
Seattle AWS server after the first hop bent-pipe.
2) Latency Variation: Starlink’s latency variation is very
high, around 3.8 times that of the terrestrial network (Shown in
Fig. 5). Given that the terrestrial network keeps a mostly stable
latency as seen in Fig. 6, the rise and falls for Starlink across
regions not observed in the terrestrial network are likely due to
the constant network path changes as satellites move closer or
further away from the dish, affecting the latency of the single
bent-pipe transmission. As shown in Fig. 7, when a connected
satellite S is moving away from the user dish (from St0 to
position St1), the latency would increase continuously until a
handover to a new satellite occurs. A closer look at the packet
level arrival time also validates this — the jitters of Starlink
are 0.255 ms (download) and 2.715 ms (upload), which are
over 5x higher than that of the terrestrial network (0.041 ms
for download and 0.546 ms for upload, respectively).

B. End-to-End Throughput
We have measured the throughput of the Starlink dish using
iperf3 with both TCP and UDP. As shown in Fig. 8, Starlink
achieves good throughput (∼80 Mb/s on average) but again
lacks stability. The throughput standard deviations for Starlink
and the terrestrial network is 50.71% and 34.44%, respectively.
Again, this variation is likely due to constantly changing
network paths from satellite movements and handovers, in
addition to potentially low-cost terrestrial network routing after
being passed over from the Starlink network.
For UDP measurements, we gradually increase iperf3’s
traffic flow until the path is saturated. Starlink’s achieved
throughput is similar across all regions (see TABLE II),
suggesting that either the dish hop is physically the bottleneck
or traffic engineering has been applied to this hop at UL or
GSL. The latter would be the root cause as the results in
IV-D3 imply that the throughput may be throttled for power
consumption control. We have also observed bursty packet
losses that are much higher than the terrestrial network. Such
losses are not necessarily caused by congestion, as we have
observed them with a low UDP throughput experiment as
well. For 20% of the presented throughput, which is low
enough to mitigate congestion factors of packet loss [33],
we still see bursty losses of 0.24% and 1.24% on average
for downloads and uploads, respectively. This is consistent
with early simulation studies for satellite communications
[34]. Interestingly, there is also a cycle around 12 hours. The
average and peak values differ from cycle to cycle but are
similar across regions during each cycle, suggesting that the
losses happen most likely on the bent-pipe, in particular, the
UL, which will be further examined in our analysis of the
routing strategy in Section IV-C.
Starlink experiences more issues with congestion control in
TCP than the terrestrial network. Our results show that Starlink
has a bandwidth utilization [33] of 39.0%, which is noticeably
lower than that of the terrestrial network (46.8%), suggesting
that TCP’s congestion control is quite sensitive to the dynamics
of the satellite hop. The newer Gen 2 dish may have optimized
TCP uploads with a 1.76x more throughput as compared to the
Gen 1 dishes in the urban city. Unfortunately, UDP uploads do
not see a similar increase, which is 0.73x of the Gen 1 dishes
in terms of throughput, implying that the improvement of TCP
uploads could be due to a more optimized access method in
the updated dish or the revised router design.
We have examined bulk data transfer through SCP. As
shown in Fig. 9, Starlink observes a larger upward trend in
transfer time with higher variances when data sizes grow.
While nearly no difference for the 1 MB data size is observed
likely due to SCP overhead, SCP over Starlink almost doubles
in transfer time compared to the terrestrial network for the
200 MB data size. Network dynamics of the satellite hop
likely have accumulated overtime and hence have amplified
the impact with larger data sizes in SCP.
C. Routing Strategy
The results from our traceroute measurements also
suggest that the Starlink network only does one bent-pipe
communication (e.g., the first UL and GSL), entering the
terrestrial network to arrive at the destination, or vice versa. In
our experiments, the Starlink network will always connect to
the geographically closest GS from the dish no matter where
the destination is. We only see a single SpaceX Services ISP
entry located at a GS nearest to the dish before the routing
switches to a terrestrial USA ISP. To the best of our efforts, we
have found no reference of Starlink using L2 routing so far. As
shown in Fig. 6, the regions, especially Sydney, Sao Paulo, and
London have similar latency patterns for the Starlink network.
We use the Pearson correlation between all the regions to
further analyze this point in Fig. 10. The regions the dish
communicates with all have moderate correlations with each
other, further implying they have similar latency patterns. De-
spite communicating with different regions, both observations
suggest that similar satellites, GSes, and routes have been
used. In other words, this single-bent-pipe architecture does
not participate in the routing strategy other than serving as the
first hop to bridge to the Internet (or last hop if the Starlink
user is the destination). Otherwise, considering that London
is closer to US East, the traffic from Vancouver should be
routed by Starlink to GSes in US East using multiple bent-
pipe transmissions before switching to the terrestrial network,
lowering the correlations against other regions not in the same
general direction as London, such as N. California, Sydney,
and Tokyo. Unfortunately, this is currently not the case as all
the correlations shown in Fig. 10 are moderate.
So far our discussion has been limited to the case of only
one end being a Starlink user. When Starlink becomes an
ubiquitous Internet service, frequently, both network endpoints
would be dish users. Ideally, the expectation is that when
two nearby dishes are within the service area of a satellite,
they can peer-to-peer exchange data using the satellite to
relay their respective ULs, without going through GSLs or
other terrestrial Internet nodes. To verify this, dishes A and
B are placed nearby, attempting to connect them directly.
Unfortunately, we have discovered that only ssh connections
are allowed by Starlink in this setup. In fact, Starlink prevents
users from editing more advanced features in typical routers
such as port forwarding. An external proxy must be used, e.g.
through remote.it,10 which, being customized for Starlink,
sets up an external AWS server as the public proxy. The
throughput averaged 2-3 Mb/s with occasional bursts to 9-
12 Mb/s; however, 27% of the throughput readings are zero.

Clearly, the tunnel-based solution does not work well yet,
needing improvements for pair-wise dish communications.
D. Environmental Influential Factors
1) Obstruction: The Starlink App gives the sky visibility
map of the dish at the current location (Fig. 3), together
with the obstruction status. The latter is only visible in the
debug mode of the App through ObstructionStats →
CurrentlyObstructed and FractionObstructed.
We referred to the fraction as obstruction ratio in this paper,
which is not always correlated with the visibility map. Around
12-24 hours is required to build the initial map, but the
obstruction ratio is updated more frequently to capture live
dynamics, e.g., fallen leaves that cover the dish. We have found
that, even if a location has a good visibility map, transient
obstruction due to foreign objects can lead to spikes in latency
or even network outage, implying that the dish is sensitive to
surface obstructions.11 In short, Starlink’s end user needs both
a clear sky and a clean dish to achieve the best performance.
2) Solar and Geomagnetic Storms: Starlink’s throughput
can be heavily affected by solar and geomagnetic storms. A
solar storm, or Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), is when massive
magnetized particles from the Sun are ejected, sometimes
towards Earth, which can interact with the earth’s magnetic
field [23].12 We have found that, during February 3rd and 4th,
2022, the dish’s throughput dropped dramatically from 100
Mb/s to 5 Mb/s. This coincides with two events: A SpaceX
mission launching 49 more satellites to space on Feb. 3rd and
11Though the Starlink App conceals obstruction status in its debug mode
with no further details, certain information can be extracted from the debug
log through a third-party tool Obstruction Viewer (http://starlink.dsmfaq.com/

a geo/electro-magnetic storm on Feb. 4th forcing 40 satellites
to re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere.13 The storm may have
strongly interfered with the UL/GSL similar to how GPS radio
waves were affected by the change in atmosphere due to a
previous geomagnetic storm [35]. Another reason could be
that the satellite constellation may have been put in a less
serviceable maintenance mode, leading to poor communication
performance. Interestingly, uploads do not seem to be affected
as the throughput stayed relatively stable. This implies that the
two directions are not symmetric when facing such storms,
which can be an important factor to consider when integrating
Starlink and the terrestrial network infrastructures.
3) Precipitation, Temperature, and Dish Power: We have
observed that the Starlink’s throughput can be significantly
affected by the weather. Results imply inverse correlations for
throughput in comparison to precipitation and temperature.
Throughput drops on average 27% during any precipitation
(see details in Fig. 11), and the throughput is capped with
heavy rain (> 4 mm per hour).14 Downloads are affected more
than uploads with UDP download having the maximum inverse

correlation of 0.34. For instance, UDP downloads is on average
215 Mb/s with no precipitation and almost halves to around
120 Mb/s with 4.1 to 5.2 mm of precipitation. Rain attenuation
is the likely culprit for the drop in throughput as Ka- and
Ku-band radio waves can suffer heavily in rainfall [36], [37].
Additionally, clouds that form in the sky could also interrupt
data communications with satellites. Even a light cloud can
affect the satellite signal strength by around 10% [15]. Thick
clouds are usually coupled with heavy rainfall, jointly blocking
the network paths in ULs and GSLs.
We have also observed a 5-26% drop in throughput when
the temperatures are above 12◦C. The Starlink dish does not
have an active cooling mechanism, only passively cooling
through its aluminum back-plate,15 which can be a significant
challenge when used in the summer or tropics.
Using an Emporia smart plug, we find that a current dish’s
power consumption averages around 56.3 Watts but can go as
high as 144.5 Watts. This is considerably lower than an earlier
reported measurement of 105 Watts on average and 190 Watts
maximum [26]. Such power saving is likely done through
firmware optimization as the dishes’ form factors remain the
same and is certainly helpful for heat control. As an extra
experiment during a snow storm in Burnaby at night from
Dec. 19 to 20, 2022, Starlink enters a snow melting mode for
10 hours, increasing its power consumption to an average of
146.3 Watts with a maximum of 188.6 Watts. Users in cold
climates must be careful as the dish requires significantly more
energy to melt the snow that could accumulate. This feature
can be turned off in the app if alternative ways is available to
keep the dish clear from snow.
Since the dish kit is a blackbox, we cannot directly measure
the power consumption of individual modules. However, we
compared the power consumption against throughput and find
that there is no obvious correlation between them, which
contrasts with the intuition that higher throughput requires
more power. In fact, in some cases, we have seen that they
are inversely correlated for both upload and download. These
suggest that the dish does not necessarily amplify the signal
further for higher throughput and that the dish may throttle
the maximum achievable throughput to control the power
consumption. Consider the summary in TABLE II, the highest
average TCP throughput in our experiments is around 108
Mb/s for download and 6 Mb/s for upload; yet a previous
experiment in Austria has observed much higher throughput
for both directions: 175 Mb/s for download and 17 Mb/s for
upload [26]. This could be due to obstructions and coverage
differences; however, the Starlink software update to lower
power consumption may have also affected the throughput.16
An updated future measurement in the same environment
would be required to test this conjecture.
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 12, the dish’s power
consumption is correlated with precipitation. Without rain,
power consumption is low in general, with occasional spikes

due to other factors such as dish direction tuning or estab-
lishing a UL with farther away satellites. When there is rain,
power consumption becomes persistently higher, likely in an
attempt to deal with the interference from the rain or clouds.
V. STARLINK IN THE WILD
Serving remote areas has always been a key target of
satellite communication systems, especially for Starlink. We
have performed a series of measurements in these challenging
environments with no terrestrial Internet coverage, not even
cellular or power services. We now present the results for two
representatives: an estuary in the far north, and a deep valley
surrounded by steep mountains.
A. Northern Shoreline
From Vancouver to the estuary (Koeye Point) involves
a 2-hour flight to Bella Bella in the north and then a 2-
hour motor boat ride along the Pacific coastline. Our trip is
for a collaborative project with biologists and the Heiltsuk
native people for salmon and forest conservation. Building a
communication service plays an important role in the project.
Our test is based on dish F.
We stayed at a simple lodge in Koeye Point built by the
Heiltsuk people. It is near the Pacific shoreline with a sky
clear of obstructions. Light pollution is low, allowing clear
sight of satellites (100%) and space stations orbiting above.
Unfortunately, even though this location is covered by Starlink
with Dish F being usable for simple day-to-day applications,
its download throughput is about 68% lower than that in the
urban city and the latency is about 11% to 30% longer, with
more interruptions. This is likely due to fewer satellites and
GSes being able to cover the northern areas (Shown in Fig. 7)
and the inclination constraint of the first shell. As such, more
efforts are required to handover to the next satellite.
B. High-Elevation Deep Valley
Our second test is at Manning Park, BC, which has rough
terrain situated around 1,000 meters above the sea surrounded
by mountains over 2,000 meters. A 3-hour drive from Vancou-
ver with basically no cellular network coverage, not to mention
Internet access. We have carried over dish C in our car to the
site with the portability option turned on, allowing the dish to
be used out of its original registered location.
Despite this valley not yet being officially serviced by
Starlink till the end of 2023,17 we were able to connect to
satellites, albeit with poor services. Latency ranged from 90-
350 ms on average across the different regions with huge

fluctuations over 1,000 ms. Throughput was on average 13
Mb/s and 4 Mb/s with rare bursts to 100 Mb/s and 20 Mb/s for
download and upload, respectively. Frequent outages happened
every 1-3 minutes, even though the App reports only a 2%
obstruction ratio. Given the terrain, we believe that any LEO
satellite, if not being directly above, would be obstructed
by the mountains. The clear short-distance visibility to the
sky within the valley would mislead the App’s algorithm in
calculating obstructions. As a matter of fact, dish C used to
be placed within a balcony in the urban city, suffering from a
24.9% obstruction ratio, but its end user experience there was
nearly as good as dishes A and B, suggesting that location
(and terrain in particular) plays an important role, and not all
obstructions are equal to the end user experience. With more
satellites being deployed and the valley becoming officially
serviceable, the service quality would be improved, if not to
the level of flat open areas.
Note that both remote locations are not connected to the
power grid, nor would be in the near future. Hence, we have
to rely on a solar-diesel hybrid power system at the estuary and
a battery power pack in the valley. Given the current Starlink
kit’s power consumption, a typical 1,500 Ah power pack lasts
only around 1 hour.
VI. FURTHER DISCUSSIONS
A. Stability of Bent-Pipe
Our earlier experiments have suggested that, despite being
reasonably good in throughput, the bent-pipe is often unstable
in communication. To closely examine its stability, we have
done a stress test under continuous streaming of an ultra-high-
resolution 8K (7,680 x 4,320 pixels) YouTube video.18 We
place two dishes (A and B) in nearby locations within the
coverage of the same satellite. In other words, they share the
same GSL but have their respective ULs. We then perform
YouTube streaming synchronously, each being attached to a
PC to playback the video. The synchronous streaming sessions
last over 24 hours by loop playing back the video, and the PCs’
browser buffers were cleaned up after each playback to ensure
continuous data downloading. We use a script to automatically
scrape YouTube’s built-in tool Stats for nerds for real-
time data statistics [26], including connection speed, network
activity, and buffer health. The buffer health represents the
length (in seconds) of pre-loaded video content which is
sensitive to network outages and directly correlated with the
viewer’s perceived quality.

Fig. 14. A Gen-1 dish secured on the roof of a minivan.
As shown in Fig. 13, both dishes have experienced a series
of buffer outages in this synchronous test, some of which are
overlapped. For instance, two pairs of buffer outages occurred
at 01:18 and 03:26 simultaneously, and their Starlink Apps
both report network outages at the same time. The overlapping
outages indicate a common factor, the bent-pipe, that caused
the outages between the two dishes. Table. III summarizes
the outage events, from which we can confirm that a non-
negligible amount of outage events are caused by their bent-
pipes (over 37.5% for A and 15.79% for B). The data also
show that Dish A is more stable in streaming than B, which
is likely because it has clearer visibility. Dish B has more
trees around, so the Starlink App reports a 2.7% and a 4.7%
obstruction ratio for Dish A and B, respectively. Hence, even in
the same service area, different Starlink users may experience
different UL quality and hence network service quality.
B. Mobility Potentials
FCC has recently authorized Starlink Internet for use on
vehicles in motion,19 though, it has yet to be fully supported
by Starlink. Hence, we have run a short test at this stage
to gauge the work needed to get Starlink ready for full in-
motion connectivity.20 We secured dish C with two crossbars
on the roof-rack of a mini van (see Fig. 14), keeping the
dish’s portability option on. In our 30-minute test, the car went
around 40 to 70 km/h around three different driving routes
with twists and turns and then a full stop near the end. Most
of the time, the dish was flat towards the sky with minor self-
adjustment. Note that the dish in the stationary setup is usually
tilted towards one direction. Hence, the dish can likely sense
motion and adjust accordingly to the flat position, which works
best for omnidirectional reception.
The current Starlink dish works while in motion but still has
a long way to go to match the current stationary setup. We
have observed outages at the median every 16.5 seconds for
5 seconds, and some every 162 seconds lasting as high as 36
seconds (95-th percentile). Latency as shown in Fig. 15 is on
average 100 ms with the highest being 2,800 ms at 20:42. The
latency spikes higher than 200 ms at least twice every minute
19https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/30/fcc-approves-spacex-starlink-service-
to-vehicles-boats-planes.html
20This test was for academic research only. Currently, Starlink does not
suggest general use of its dishes in motion, although there have been trials,
notably in Ukraine, and Starlink also plans to release an RV version.

on average with as high as 8 times in a minute. This would
frequently interrupt applications that require sub-200 ms for
satisfying experiences. Considering that a stationary dish in
our previous experiments averages around 50 ms, the latency
while mobile is high with larger fluctuations. Some latency
increases could be due to sudden orientation changes as the car
turns around corners or intermittent obstructions from passing
trees. For example, a right-hand turn occurred at around 20:40,
which coincides with the sharp spike in latency at around the
same time. Download throughput reaches similar averages to
the stationary test at around 80 to 100 Mb/s but immediately
drops off near the end, as shown in Fig. 16. Upload throughput,
interestingly, is able to keep up around 5 to 10 Mb/s, on par
with that of the stationary setup. Both observe a noticeable
drop at around 20:58, likely due to a disconnection from the
satellite. The last 6 minutes is a straight drive in a valley,
where the drop in throughput suggests that perhaps the dish
was forced hand-over satellites faster than expected.
Note that the Starlink kit typically takes 3-7 minutes to boot
up and be Internet ready, but we have observed cases over 20
minutes. Such a long time will be a barrier for mobile use.
C. Global Coverage? Technical and Cultural Implications
More Starlink satellites are required to achieve true global
coverage, including other shells to cover the North and South
Poles. Our remote area experiments were done 14° south of
the Arctic Circle (66°34’N), which is already almost out of
the current service area in North America. Inter-satellite links
are necessary to be enabled for efficient cross-continent com-
munications and robust operations when disasters happen near
the Earth’s surface. We have realized many challenges during
our site visit deep into the Great Bear temperate rainforest at
the estuary’s upstream, where we plan to install a Starlink dish
near the Heiltsuk aboriginal people’s reconstructed weir for a
fish trap monitoring system.
Practical challenges include clearance, wildlife, and power.
The old-growth trees are 30 meters tall, and the only clear
sky available is on the riverbank, which is subject to flooding.
Wildlife such as bears, wolves, and birds could easily cross
the narrow weir and disrupt the dish. As a matter of fact, one
hundred distinct individual grizzly bears have been identified
in the Koeye watershed. Also, solar is the only source of power
available in such a remote area in the deep forest (The diesel
generator is not allowed nor practical). As such, intermittent
operations are inevitable as the dish needs a max of 145 watts
of power or more if it enters snow melting mode.
Cultural challenges are more complicated, which we have
not considered before the site visit. The Koeye river and
surrounding temperate rainforest is a holy land for the Heiltsuk
natives, hosting their traditional big house. The people there
bring their set of conflicts and traditional values. Signal pollu-
tion includes the philosophical thought of pristine wilderness
and as more of the world is connected, fewer places can serve
as a getaway from constant connectivity. Light pollution is
common, however, a global coverage brought by the LEO
satellite constellation would bring another pollution of invisi-
ble electromagnetic waves, the WiFi pollution. This is not in
terms of the technological aspect but in the social aspect. This
is a major concern of the biologists working with us. In the
true wild, individuals must always stay alert and mostly take
care of themselves; hence, the distraction of using mobile apps
would overshadow the benefit of staying connected. Policies,
professional guidelines, and ethics across different disciplines
and cultures are therefore urgently needed for the forthcoming
global Internet coverage on Earth and in space.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
This paper has presented our initial measurements on the
network characteristics of today’s Starlink from an end-user’s
perspective. Many of the issues identified from our study
are not just confined to Starlink, but are common for LSNs.
Our observations therefore will help with optimizing the LSN
deployment and operation, and will also help developers and
users customize their networks and applications.
LSN services are rapidly evolving, so we will be continuing
to monitor the performance evolution of Starlink’s Internet ser-
vice. For instance, the weather or cloud effects on Starlink can
be further expanded with rain probability and cloud models to
provide uninterruptible service. We are also interested in the
effectiveness of the upcoming new functions, e.g., satellite-to-
satellite links and mobility support, to name but a few.
