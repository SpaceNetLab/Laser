communication relay service could be provided by a partially constructed constellation through buffering data and forwarding it at a later time. However, this will introduce extra end-to-end delay during the construction period. We propose a scheme to determine an optimal construction process, which is used to insert satellites into appropriate positions in each stage of construction.

end-to-end delay by 70.1%, compared to the traditional scheme which inserts the satellites into one orbital plane in each stage. II. PROBLEM STATEMENT A. Network Model Time-varying graph (TVG) is a useful high level abstraction for studying connectivity over time in the satellite network. Recently, the authors in  have proposed a uniﬁed framework for TVGs, and following this framework, we will use their deﬁnitions and notations in our analysis. Let U be a set of M users, namely U = {u1, · · · , uM}. Satellites will be launched and injected into N positions which are evenly distributed among P orbits. Satellite in the j-th position of the i-th orbit is denoted as s(i,j). As a result, the set of these N satellites is denoted as S = {s(i,j)|1 ≤i ≤P, i ≤j ≤N/P}. Vertices representing the satellites and users are denoted as V = U ∪S. There are no edges between users. Users do not relay messages between satellites, not like the users in . Thus, the set of possible edges between vertices and satellites is denoted as E = {(v, s) : v ∈V, s ∈S}. Events occur over a time span T ⊆T, where T is the temporal domain. In a general case, a TVG is denoted as a tuple: G = (V, E, T , ρ, ζ). (1) ρ :E×T →{0, 1} is called presence function of edge, which indicates whether a given edge e = (v, s) exists at a given time. 1558-2558 © 2015 IEEE.

LIU et al.: DELAY MINIMIZATION FOR PROGRESSIVE CONSTRUCTION OF SATELLITE CONSTELLATION NETWORK 1719 ζ :E × T →T is called latency function of edge, which indicates the transmission latency over a given edge at a given time. ψ :V × T →{0, 1} is called presence function of vertex, which indicates whether a given vertex exists at a given time. The bandwidth of edge e at a given time t is assumed to be B(e, t). The construction of satellite constellation network includes K stages, where K ≥1. The time for k-th stage is denoted as

S ATELLITE constellation networks, such as Iridium-Next , Globalstar-2  and Orbcomm-2 , typically need several stages to complete the construction. Each stage usually takes several months, during which only a few satellites could be inserted into target positions. In the constellation construction, a partially formed constellation could buffer data on certain satellites, and forward the data at a later time when the links between satellites and users become available –. This strategy could provide relay services to users in areas where terrestrial communication infrastructure is not available. However, extra end-to-end delay is introduced in this period. Moreover, different schemes for constructing constellation may result in different intermediate satellite networks, hence yielding different end-to-end delay. In fact, a carefully planned process for the satellite network will serve users with low endto-end delay, which is an important service target in .

In each stage, the process in Fig. 1(a) inserts satellites into different planes, while the process in Fig. 1(b) inserts satellites into one plane. By the end of the ﬁrst stage, Fig. 1(c) and (d) show the time windows of ground-satellite links (GSLs) within the case of Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. In Fig. 1(c), u1 will wait until t1 to upload data to s21 when the data arrive at u1 on t0. Then, the uploaded data needs to be carried and stored on s21 for a time period T1 due to such long distance between u1 and u2. Finally, the data can be downloaded to u2 as early as at t2. Similarly, if the process in Fig. 1(b) is taken, data will arrive Manuscript received February 14, 2015; revised July 11, 2015; accepted July 24, 2015.

Due to t4 ≫t2, it is reasonable to claim that the former construction process is better than the latter. In this letter, we propose a scheme to minimize the delay by designing an optimal construction process. We also evaluate the delay performance in the construction period. In each stage, our scheme decides the positions which satellites should be inserted into, and we analyze its fuel cost and time cost. Finally,

In this letter, we propose a novel scheme to progressively construct satellite constellation network. Our scheme inserts satellites into the positions, that could belong to different orbital planes. The target positions are at most distributed among 3 orbital planes subject to time deployment constraint. Our
