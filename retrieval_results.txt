LEO satellites have become a subject of extensive research in recent years, with a particular focus on advancing the performance of various systems and technologies. Starlink, the posterchild of LEO networks, continues to grow in its maturity and reach with > 2M subscribers as of September 2023 . Despite its growing popularity, there has been limited exploration into measuring Starlink‚Äôs performance so far. Existing studies either have a narrow scope, employing only a few vantage points  or focus on broad application-level operation  without investigating root-causes. Few studies have looked into the mobile behavior of Starlink and compared it to terrestrial cellular carriers . A few endeavors have attempted to unveil the operations of Starlink‚Äôs black-box network. Pan et al.  revealed the operator‚Äôs internal network topology from traceroutes, whereas Tanveer et al.  spotlighted a potential global network controller. The absence of global measurement sites poses a predominant challenge hampering a comprehensive understanding of Starlink‚Äôs performance. As we show in this work, Starlink‚Äôs performance varies geographically due to differing internal configurations and ground infrastructure availability. Some researchers have devised innovative methods to combat this. For example, Izhikevich et al. conducted measurements towards exposed services behind the Starlink user terminal, while Taneja et al.  mined social media platforms like Reddit to gauge the LEO network‚Äôs performance. Our

Similar observations about latency in LEO networks have already been made in other work . However, a new and surprising finding here is about the comparison of the constellations. Telesat has the fewest satellites, with less than a third of Kuiper‚Äôs and less than a fourth of Starlink‚Äôs, and yet it achieves the lowest latencies for most connections. Starlink‚Äôs latencies are also higher than Kuiper‚Äôs.

We presented a network topology for global constellations of interconnected LEO satellite internet networks that supports a low-cost, location-oriented routing scheme. We demonstrate that √óGrid has fewer hops between common routes than conventional +Grid configurations. The √óGrid topology orients ISLs to the direction of motion, allowing client state information to be handed off to direct neighbors. Additionally, the routing scheme atop √óGrid facilitates the selection of appropriate return node knowing only the estimated RTT. We demonstrate efficacy of √óGrid and the routing scheme through simple simulations. In this simulation we show that √óGrid alone delivers approximately 20% more packets due to reduced latency in the number of hops, and that our routing scheme performs similarly to plain √óGrid while never dropping packets due to handoff.

SpaceX, Amazon, and others plan to put thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit to provide global low-latency broadband Internet. SpaceX‚Äôs plans have matured quickly, such that their underdeployment satellite constellation is already the largest in history, and may start offering service in 2020. The proposed constellations hold great promise, but also present new challenges for networking.

‚Ä¢ We lay out the case for building network analysis tools for upcoming LEO networks. As a first step towards meeting this need, we develop Hypatia, an analysis framework capturing the orbital dynamics of LEO networks. ‚Ä¢ We use regulatory filings by the largest three planned LEO networks to evaluate and visualize their networks. ‚Ä¢ Using packet-level simulations, we analyze the behavior of individual end-end connections across such networks in terms of their changing latencies and path structure, and show how this impacts congestion control negatively, even in the absence of any competing traffic. ‚Ä¢ Further, by simulating traffic constellation-wide, we show that the changes in path structure result in a difficult problem for routing and traffic engineering, as the utilization of paths and links is highly dynamic. ‚Ä¢ Hypatia‚Äôs visualizations aid intuition about the structure of satellite trajectories and their impact on a constellation‚Äôs behavior, and pin-point traffic hotspots in the network and show their evolution over time. Satellite networking played an important role in laying the foundations of the Internet, and may again provide the impetus for substantial and exciting changes.

for optimizing the performance of modern satellite networks, as listed below. ‚Ä¢ (i) Emerging mega-constellations indeed offer low-latency opportunities for long-distance communications if ISLs are deployed, especially for communications between different continents. The attainable network performance can be signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by the concrete constellation design. Satellites working on lower orbits may provide lower latency due to the shortened route length. However, lower orbits are also faster with a higher orbital velocity, which is more likely to cause intermittent network connectivity and higher jitter. Thus, the constellation design and network policies should be jointly optimized to support various upper applications. ‚Ä¢ (ii) The orbital decision and the scale of satellites can signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the resilience of the constellation.

characterizing the network performance of emerging LEO megaconstellations. However, constructing a hybrid constellation that integrates satellites working in various kinds of orbit (e.g., LEO, GEO and MEO) to collaboratively provide global network access, is another blooming picture in the evolution of SNs. We will extend STARPERF to model and proÔ¨Åle such kind of hybrid SNs in the future. Authorized licensed use limited to: Tsinghua University.

for optimizing the performance of modern satellite networks, as listed below. ‚Ä¢ (i) Emerging mega-constellations indeed offer low-latency opportunities for long-distance communications if ISLs are deployed, especially for communications between different continents. The attainable network performance can be signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by the concrete constellation design. Satellites working on lower orbits may provide lower latency due to the shortened route length. However, lower orbits are also faster with a higher orbital velocity, which is more likely to cause intermittent network connectivity and higher jitter. Thus, the constellation design and network policies should be jointly optimized to support various upper applications. ‚Ä¢ (ii) The orbital decision and the scale of satellites can signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the resilience of the constellation.
